<h2 class="ls">SECTION I.</h2>

<p class="center"><i>The arguments considered which oppose the doctrine of Spectres.</i><br>
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Among</span> the opinions of the present day, which render it
neither clear nor dark, is that of materialism, which maintains
the position that all exercises of the mind are the exercises
of matter more or less refined and organized: Therefore,
when this material organization ceases, all cogitation
must cease: Body and soul, life and intelligence die together.
Thought, and the capacity of thought have no existence
between death and the last day. Now if this position and
inference be true, the doctrine of Spectres is overthrown at
once. Sure we may be that what never exists can never
really appear, however I may be deluded by my own imagination,
or the artifice of others. This position therefore,
before we proceed, demands particular discussion.</p>

<p>If thought be the entire effect of material form, and excellent
thought of excellent form, as these philosophers seem to
suppose, it follows that the more excellent the body is the
more excellent will be the mind. But facts shew the contrary.
The goose, which sometimes appears in elegant human
form, we despise; while we admire the fables of Æsop and
the sublime verse of that poet, who was told what is the mark
of interrogation. “But although the externals of body may
be deformed, yet the internals of it may be well organized
and refined.” What says the anatomist respecting the
ourang outang? “Not only the externals, but the internals
of his body resemble those of man, particularly the tongue
and the brain. There appears no difference between them;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</span>
yet the animal is dumb and has not so much sagacity even
to provide for herself as the elephant or the beaver.” However
certain laws and dispensations of Divine Providence,
accommodated to the rude apprehensions of mankind in early
ages, punished the posterity of sinners; yet it is one of the
first dictates of reason as well as of a better covenant, that
justice does not require any person to be rewarded or punished
for the virtues or vices of another.<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> If soul and body
die together; if all intelligence and cogitation cease from
that moment to the last day, what becomes of personal identity
and accountability? The essence of personality is intelligence.
Every intelligent being is a person, and every
person an intelligent being.<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> Therefore the uninterrupted
continuation of any particular intelligence, necessarily implies
his personal identity; whatever body, or whatever garment
he may, or may not, happen to wear. Therefore,
premising deference, personal identity does not necessarily
comprise the whole man, soul and body, as Dr. Watts supposes,
nor is it the mere consciousness of my past and present
experience compared, as Mr. Locke supposes; for this my very
consciousness presupposes that existence of which I am conscious.
I may have committed faults and performed virtuous
actions in time past, which now I do not remember, and therefore
not conscious of them; still those actions were mine,
whether I am conscious of them or not, and so far as any one
can prove them to be mine, so far he can prove me to be the
same person that I was in the time when those actions were
performed. For more instruction, the reader may consult
that excellent dissertation of Bishop Butler, on this topic;
from which I extract a few lines: “As upon two triangles
being compared or viewed together, there arises to the mind
the idea of similitude; or upon twice two and four, the idea
of equality—so likewise upon comparing the consciousness
of one’s self in any two moments, there immediately arises
to the mind the idea of personal identity. And as the two
former comparisons not only give us the ideas of similitude
and equality, but also shew us that two triangles are alike,
and twice two and four are equal—so the latter comparison
not only gives us the idea of personal identity, but also shows<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</span>
us the identity of ourselves in those two moments, that is,
the present and that immediately past; or the present and
that of a month, a year, or twenty years past. Or in other
words, by reflecting upon that which is myself now, and that
which was myself twenty years ago, I discern they are not
two, but one and the same self. But the consciousness of
what is past, does thus ascertain our personal identity to
ourselves, yet to say that it <em>makes</em> personal identity, is to say
that a person has not existed a single moment, nor done one
action but what he can remember, and none but what he reflects
upon. And one should really think it self evident that
consciousness of personal identity presupposes, and therefore
cannot <em>constitute</em> personal identity, any more than knowledge
in any other case can constitute the truth which it presupposes.”</p>

<p>If this account of personal identity be just, then, by the
doctrine here opposed, death puts an end to it. Affection,
thought, intelligence, consciousness, all are no more, and
therefore the person is no more. And as he is no more,
nothing can be his. Now existence is entitled to no reward,
deserves no punishment: is guilty of nothing and accountable
for nothing. In a future day something may be raised
up just like him in body and natural faculties of mind. But
for this something, creation, not resurrection, is the appropriate
term. Now can we conceive that the person struck entirely
out of existence a thousand years ago, and this person
newly created in his likeness, should be one and the same?
No, we can as well conceive that two small houses built a
thousand miles apart, and entirely resembling each other,
are one and the same house. These new persons, if they
reason, as some of us do, will think it somewhat strange that
they should be accountable for crimes said to have been
committed by them long before they were created. This
doctrine, however, affords comfort and encouragement to
all distinction of sinners in this world. Our punishment
in a future state, say they, will not be inflicted upon <em>us</em>,
(for after death we shall exist no more) but upon our representatives
who shall bear our names, and be made to think
that they were we. Let us then eat and drink, for to-morrow
we die. Let us imitate those noble animals around us,
which innocently deceive, kill and take possession; for to-morrow
we shall exist no longer. What a foul reproach then does
this doctrine exhibit against the wisdom and equity of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</span>
righteous Governor of the world? We now attend to the
language of scripture respecting this opinion. The parable
of the rich man and Lazarus, is grounded on the hypothesis
that some persons are happy or miserable in the separate
state, while others are living in the present world. The
text, “Absent from the body and present with the Lord,” by
the subtle philosophy of this enlightened age, signifies that
after we, as persons, have been annihilated for some ages,
a number of new persons, just then created, who shall be our
very selves, will be present with the Lord. But in view of
the simple christian, who knows but little, the plain meaning
of the text is, that in the very same hour and minute,
while we are absent from this corruptible body, we are present
with the Lord. Such an ignorant christian is not able
to conceive how a person, and a similar person residing on
the two opposite shores of the vast duration of nihility,
can be one and the same person, any more than to conceive
how a person and a similar person, residing at the same time
on the opposite shores of the vast Atlantic, can be one and
the same person. Our Lord said to the penitent thief, “This
day shalt thou be with me in paradise;” that is, before the
close of this natural day thou shalt be with me in heaven.
So the penitent thief in his state of ignorance would naturally
understand it. But Priestlian subtilty requires this paraphrase,
“This day shalt thou die, soul and body, and remain
personally annihilated about two thousand years.” Then a
person entirely new shall begin to exist, and shall erroneously
imagine that within a few months he had committed a
theft, that within a few hours he had been crucified, and obtained
a promise which was now completely fulfilled. All
this deception will take place, because he will be you. However,
by intercourse with others, he and you will discover
these chronological errors, and that those things which you
had done, suffered and enjoyed, took place about two thousand
years before you, that is, before the second you, existed.
It was well for the thief that he knew not, and believed not,
this paraphrase; otherwise that promise would have been a
poor, cold consolation to him. The Sadducees denied the
resurrection, and the existence of angel and spirit, and their
denial of the former was grounded on their denial of the
latter. They seemed to admit, that, if spirits existed in a
separate state, they might assume bodies. But as there <em>were</em>
no such spirits in their view, the inference was certain,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</span>
that no such transition could take place. Therefore the
argument of our Saviour attacked the very foundation of
their theory, by shewing that the patriarchs, though dead
for many years, and their bodies not raised, were still alive,
while Moses stood at the burning bush.<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> Our Lord cited
these words, addressed to Moses at that time, “I am the God
of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob;” and
then says, “God is not the God of the dead, but of the living,
for all live unto him.” That is to say, they do not live
unto man. In his natural view, they are dead in every respect.
They see no life in his body, nor any where else; still
they live unto God. In his view they have life, thought, affection
and intelligence. Therefore those dead patriarchs
were alive at the time when Moses beheld the burning bush.
“Fear not them which kill the body, saith our Lord, but are
not able to kill the soul.”<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> But why? What is the reason
they are not able to kill the soul? If soul and body die together—if
death destroys the essential properties of the soul
as well as of the body, certainly they, who are able to kill
the body, are able to kill the soul. But the words now cited
were uttered by him who could not err; and for the writer
it is impossible to conceive how words could be framed to
make a proposition more plain and intelligible. But in this
age of light and darkness, many, who believe <a id="chg1"></a>in immortality
and the separate state, utterly deny that any departed soul
ever returns or becomes visible to our bodily eyes. Of this
persuasion are the authors of the American Cyclopedia.
Their arguments, which demand attention, are the following:
The first argument contemplates the ignorance and vulgarity
associated with the opinion which maintains the existence
of Spectres. “It is true there were many Christians in former
times, who gave full credit to such narratives; these
were times of great ignorance and superstition. But since
philosophy and christianity have walked hand in hand, the
faith of ghosts has been more and more renounced, invariably.”
So it seems that if a pious man has learning enough,
he is perfectly secure from all such delusions. But is this
representation entirely consonant with facts? That christian<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</span>
literature has invariably renounced this opinion is by no
means correct. Not only was the faith of Spectres supported
by some of the most learned and eminent characters of
antiquity, but moderns, illustrious both in theology and philosophy,
even since the Protestant Reformation, have given
their decided opinion in favor of this doctrine. Among
others, are Doctor Lightfoot, Mr. Flavel, Mr. Hervy, Mr.
Addison, Doctor Samuel Johnson, and the excellent Mr.
Swedenbourg. Will it be proved that all these modern names
are entirely ignorant either of theology or philosophy?</p>

<p>“What more frequent in times of popery than apparitions?
Says President Mather, it would fill a volume to rehearse
them; yet we may not run into the other extreme, that all
such reports have no reality.” But what do philosophers
know respecting this affair more than other people? What
lesson in the whole circle of science has ever determined the
question, whether sounds or forms were ever produced by
unembodied spirits? What ancient Sadducee or modern materialist
has ever yet proved that the human thoughts have
not a separate existence by vehicle, or in some other way?</p>

<p>Had our authors told us that the belief of Spectres has
been rejected invariably wherever philosophy and modern
infidelity have gone hand in hand, the sentence would have
been perfectly accurate. The christian world affords no
infidel who would not ridicule the following letters.</p>

<p>We see an age of light and darkness—of improvement and
misimprovement. Ignorance is supported, when we believe
too much, or when we believe too little. And a wise mariner
will stand aloof both from Scylla and Charybdis—from the
prejudice of superstition and the prejudice of modernism.</p>

<p>The foundation of theology is the Sacred Scriptures, and
there we find the doctrine of apparitions. Samuel appeared
to Saul when he applied for advice to the witch of Endor.<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>
There is however no proof that his appearance was the effect
of her own power. Two things terrified her: one was the
discovery of Saul; the other was, Aliem, a god, rising out of
the earth. How could she be terrified merely by the expected
effect of her own invention? It is most reasonable to
suppose that the event exceeded her expectation—that Samuel
really appeared—not to flatter Saul by a sentence of
double meaning, like the heathen oracles; but to speak like
himself—to reprove Saul for coming there, and to denounce<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</span>
that terrible sentence upon him and his house, which might
naturally be expected from that faithful prophet.</p>

<p>When the disciples saw Jesus walking on the sea, they
were troubled, saying, it is a spirit, and they cried out for
fear; but his answer was, “Be of good cheer, it is I; be not
afraid.” Here we see the disciples believed the existence of
Spectres, and here was a fair opportunity for our Lord to
teach them the contrary. But he did not thus improve it:
for after his resurrection they discovered the same opinion.
He asked one of them to handle him; not to disprove their
opinion, but to prove his resurrection. Some time after this,
Peter, miraculously delivered from prison, knocked at the
house of Mary, where many were gathered for prayer. The
damsel Rhoda, constantly affirmed to them that she heard
Peter’s voice. Then said they, “It is his angel.” Thus
their opinion continued the same through the fairest opportunities
of their being taught otherwise by unerring wisdom.
But they had never read Voltaire, nor Hume’s observation
on the Sprights of the British Fathers.</p>

<p><abbr title="Argument"><span class="smcap">Arg.</span></abbr> 2. “When the Scriptures were written and published,
and the christian religion fully established, revelation
ceased, and miracles and heavenly messages were no longer
requisite.”</p>

<p>How do they know? How <em>can</em> they know these matters,
unless by the Scriptures? And where do they say, that after
the establishment of christianity, miracles and heavenly
messages should be no longer requisite? It is believed that
no such passage can be found.</p>

<p>It was the full persuasion of Mr. Addison, that the power
of working miracles continued in the church many years
after the Apostolic age. He informs us that learned christians
of those times, “Confidently assert this miraculous
power; nay, tell us that they themselves had been eye witnesses
of it at several times and in several instances. Nay,
appeal to the heathen themselves for the truth of several
facts they relate; nay, challenge them to be present at their
assemblies, and satisfy themselves, if they doubt it; nay,
we find that pagan authors have in some instances confessed
this miraculous power.”<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p>

<p>Doubtless the Scriptures contain rules sufficient for salvation.
And every opposite rule, though preached by an
angel, must be rejected; and the same was true of the Old<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</span>
Testament before the New was revealed. But it will by no
means follow that no succeeding age of the world can afford
an occasion for any miracle or heavenly message which is
<em>consistent</em> with the Scriptures. That “the whole will of
God is revealed in the Scriptures,” as it respects our general
conduct, is doubtless true; and the same was true of the
law of Moses, as it respected the general conduct of Israel in
the days of the Judges. He was pronounced cursed, who
took away or added thereunto. But hence it did not follow
that an angel could not appear to Manoah and his wife, promise
them a child, and give directions concerning his education.
To say that the whole will of God is so revealed in
the Scriptures, that no case whatever can require any extraordinary
exhibition of his will, is to say what is never said
in that sacred volume, and is no better than begging the
question.</p>

<p>There may be miracles and heavenly messages without
innovation of Scripture doctrine or worship. “To say that
God does not send his angels to any of his saints to communicate
his mind unto them, as to some particulars of their
own duty <em>according to his word</em>, seems in my judgment, says
the great Doctor Owen, to limit unwarrantably the Holy
One of Israel.”</p>

<p><abbr title="Argument"><span class="smcap">Arg.</span></abbr> 3. “Can we suppose that the all-wise Governor of
the world would permit his angels to render themselves visible
to the eye of man, for a purpose which might have been
equally well accomplished without their interposition?”</p>

<p>This question is very easy. Another might appear more
difficult. Have our authors such perfect knowledge of the
universal system, that they can certainly tell us what purposes
can be equally well accomplished without the interposition
of angels, as with it?</p>

<p>The hairs of the head and the smallest animalculæ are
numbered; so are all events. Small events by connection
are frequently great events. If therefore, the purposes for
which a spirit is said to appear, are as small and trivial as
can be conceived of, it would by no means follow that the
message did not come from the invisible state. That which
appears very trivial in our view, may appear vastly important
in the view of those seven eyes which survey the whole
system of Providence, and destroy the wisdom of the wise.</p>

<p><abbr title="Argument"><span class="smcap">Arg.</span></abbr> 4. “Death is as great a change as that of our birth.
And is it not as improbable that a man should visibly return<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</span>
after death, as that he should return from a state of manhood,
to that which preceded his birth?” That is to say; Is
it not as improbable that a species of miracle should take
place, the existence of which has been taught and believed
in all ages and nations, and is the manifest lesson of the
Scriptures; as that a species of miracle should take place,
which nobody ever believed or heard of?</p>

<p><em>Is it not as improbable that a man should rise from the
dead at the last day, as that he should return from a state of
manhood to that which preceded his birth.</em></p>

<p>This question of the infidel demands some attention, as
well as the question in view.</p>

<p><abbr title="Argument"><span class="smcap">Arg.</span></abbr> 5. “There is a strong objection against the probability
of Spectres, which is sufficient to prove that they are
not intelligent creatures; or at least, that they possess so
small a degree of intelligence, that they are unqualified to
act with prudence, to propose any end to themselves, or use
the proper means to accomplish that end. Ghosts often appear
in order to discover some crime; but they never appear
to a magistrate, or person in authority, but to some illiterate
clown, who happens to live near the place where the crime
was perpetrated: to some person who has no connection with
the affair at all, and who, in general, is the most improper
in the world for making the discovery.”</p>

<p>In Glanville’s Saducismus Triumphatus, we have the following
story:—</p>

<p>“James Haddock, a farmer, was married to Eleanor
Welsh, by whom he had a son. After the death of Haddock,
his wife married one Davis, and both agreed to defraud the
son by the former marriage, of a lease bequeathed to him
by his father. Upon this the ghost of Haddock appeared to
one Francis Tavernor, the servant of Lord Chichester, and
desired him to go to Eleanor Welsh and inform her that it
was the will of her former husband that the son should enjoy
the lease. Tavernor did not at first execute this commission,
but he was continually haunted by the apparition
in the most hideous shapes, which even threatened to tear
him in pieces, till at last he delivered the message. Now
had this Spectre the least common sense, it would have appeared
first to Eleanor Welsh and her husband, Davis, and
frightened them into compliance at once, and not have kept
poor Tavernor in such constant disquietude, who had no
concern in the matter.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</span>
Here we find several propositions with regard to Spectres
in general, which demand credit only for one short story,
the truth of which might be as consistently disputed by the
apparitionists, as by the Encyclopedia. It does not appear
that this apparition was seen or heard by any one except
Tavernor. What evidence then have we that Tavernor was
not the dupe of one who personated Haddock out of pity to
the orphan son?</p>

<p>Could our authors imagine that Mr. Addison, Doctor
Johnson, or even Mr. Glanville himself, built the faith of
Spectres, only on such feeble evidence as this story affords?</p>

<p>Will that mode of conduct adopted by Tavernor’s Spectre,
teach us what is the conduct of Spectres in general, till we,
who believe the reality of Spectres, can be satisfied whether
Tavernor ever saw a Spectre or not?</p>

<p>Circumstances unknown to us, however, might be so attached
to that affair, as to render it credible to Davis and
his wife, if not to others.</p>

<p>Therefore, admitting the supposition of our believing it a
reality, how have our authors proved that this very Spectre
conducted imprudently, proposed no end to himself, or used
no proper means to accomplish that end? “Because, say
they, he did not first appear to Eleanor Welsh and her husband,
and frighten them into compliance at once.” But
how does it appear that this summary method, all things
considered, would have been the most eligible. Doubtless
some infidels are bold enough to say that the angel, who
sent Moses to Pharaoh from Horeb, would have conducted
much more prudently and rationally, if he had first appeared
to Pharaoh, and frightened him into compliance at once,
than to have kept Moses in such disquietude, who had less
concern in the matter than any man in Egypt, for he was
now married and peaceably settled in another land. The
end proposed by the ghost appearing to Tavernor was, that
the son of Haddock should enjoy the lease, and this end
was subordinate and absolutely necessary to other ends of
far greater magnitude, for any thing which the Cyclopedia
has shewn to the contrary.</p>

<p>We find in the Scriptures such a connection of means
and ends as the wisdom of some moderns would never dictate:
as that of <abbr title="Ezekiel">Ezek.</abbr> 4: 15, and the marriage of Hosea
transacted, either in reality or in vision. These means,
doubtless, would not have appeared the most decent and eligible<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</span>
to some of those who seem capable of dictating for apparitions,
the proper mode of their procedure.</p>

<p>But suppose Tavernor’s ghost had first appeared to Eleanor
Welsh and her husband, and frighted them into compliance
at once, would the existence of Spectres be any
more believed than it is at present? Would not the objection
have been that Eleanor Welsh had the maternal affection
for her son? Had never really consented to the crime—that
her own fear was feigned, and that the ghost was
some friend employed by her to frighten and deceive her
husband?</p>

<p>Or if the ghost had first appeared to a magistrate: should
we not have been told how much more probable it was that
a magistrate should bear a part in some artifice which afforded
him profit, than that a miracle had happened equal
to the transition from a state of manhood to that which preceded
our birth? It is no dishonor to the most illustrious of
mankind that they frequently entertain the same opinion as
that of their inferiors. On the mode of conduct proper for
a Spectre, our authors agree in sentiment with that Heroine
of a famous English ballad,<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> who with the habiliments there
described, frightened a person into compliance at once.
She gave him no opportunity to deliberate or to authenticate
her mission. Compliance, or immediate ruin were his
only alternative. Her name was honored by three queens,
and the favor of Henry the eighth.</p>

<p>Spectres from heaven are rational creatures, and come
down from the fountain of reason, and will therefore deal
reasonably with us, by allowing us a fair opportunity to ascertain
the reality of their mission. But for this examination,
the mind is incapable when terrified by a sudden surprise.</p>

<p>Eleanor Welsh being the mother of the injured, must have
been interested, and therefore, if the Spectre had first appeared
to her and her husband, there certainly would have
been less evidence of reality (coct. par) than there was by
its first appearing to Tavernor, who, by the very supposition
of our author, was a disinterested person, and “had no concern
in the matter.”</p>

<p>We find in the next place several naked assertions, and
then the inference that, “The evidence of Spectres is destroyed.”
They tell us that Spectres appear only to one person<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</span>
at a time—that they are seen only in the night, and
visible only to the illiterate and credulous. “A man must
be prejudiced in favor of this opinion beforehand, say they,
or he will never see a ghost.”</p>

<p>I must not offend the reader by needless detention. He
may easily find instances to disprove these assertions. As
to the last, besides Doctor Scott, several persons of distinguished
abilities, probity and literature, who have seen
ghosts, have declared to the writer, that instead of previously
believing their existence, their minds had been strongly
prejudiced against it.</p>

<p>Our authors desire to know why Spectres should appear
in the night, and “why they could not deliver their messages
with as much ease and more success in the day time.”
And doubtless Bolingbroke had a similar enquiry respecting
the angel who appeared to the shepherds in the night.</p>

<p>“To render the testimony of any person credible, say
these writers, he must not only be a man of veracity, but of
sufficient ability to judge of the subject to which he is to
bear witness. It is not on the evidence of an ignorant, illiterate
person, who has more fancy and fear than judgment,
that we are to rest our belief of what is supernatural.”
Here again their weapon is from the arsenal of those who
oppose our Saviour’s resurrection, known first to some of
“the timorous and pious sex,” as Hume has termed them,
and then to illiterate, ignorant fishermen, who, say the
deists, had more fancy and fear than judgment. The truth
is, some ignorant men have no more fancy nor fear than the
learned, and a much better judgment than many of the
latter. The corporeal senses of the illiterate are as infallible
as those of the learned. The former can see and hear
a ghost or an angel as distinctly as the latter, and can attempt
to handle a ghost with as much composure of mind,
and so are capable of knowing whether they can feel a substance
or not, as a Locke or a Newton.</p>

<p>On the whole, it appears that the reason why mankind in
this enlightened age, must believe that apparitions are a
mere fiction, is not because this negative thesis was ever
established by any solid demonstration, but because the
unanimity of modern names, the substitute of argument, has
given it popularity.</p>

<p>Doubtless the counterfeit apparitions which duped the
popish ages, were numerous; but counterfeits will never
prove that there is nothing to be counterfeited.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</span>
Among the greatest impositions of this nature, where
shall we find one, which will compare with the late events
of Sullivan, in the county of Hancock, Maine. In that
place has never been found any theatrical representation, or
magic glass, or lantern, or ventriloquist, or speaking automaton,
or Phantasmagoria, or Statue of Kircher: and were
all these means of imposition found there, they would afford
no rational explanation of the subsequent phenomena.
How easy of solution was that fraud in the city of Bern,
mentioned by Mosheim,<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> as imposed upon one Jetzer, by
four Dominicans, to confirm their doctrine of original sin.
The apparition was indeed terrific, and exhibited false miracles,
but never offered to appear in the day time, nor predict
any event, which could not be foreknown by other means,
nor was there any address to the sense of feeling to satisfy
Jetzer that the Spectre was a Phantom.</p>

<p>The Encyclopedia have related a wonderful artifice from
Doctor Plot, performed undoubtedly by a number of persons
at Woodstock, in England, soon after the death of king
Charles the first, while certain commissioners appointed to
survey his property there, were engaged to accomplish their
business. But in all that marvelous story, we find no comparison
with the events we are about to contemplate. The
only apparition seen there, was that of a dog! none of them
observed the manner of his being introduced among them.
They saw no changes of shape or magnitude, nor does it
appear that any of them saw him vanish. They heard no
articulate voice, much less any declaration of truth, unattainable
by other means.</p>

<p>As to the Cocklane ghost, which produced so much noise
and credit in London; there was neither articulate voice,
nor any kind of apparition. All these artifices, and a
thousand more which history commemorates, are swallowed
up by the subsequent phenomena, as Aaron’s rod swallowed
up the rods of the magicians.</p>

<p>Pause then, reader, and consider a few moments what
evidence would convince you of the existence of a Spectre.
Before you stands a creature encircled with radiance resembling
the sun. Through the rays you behold a personal
form as plainly as possible. This form speaks to you.
The same is seen and heard by thirty others at the same
time and in the same manner, so that your experience and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</span>
theirs are uniform; while two or three other persons with
the same ocular advantages, and looking in the same direction,
hear the voice, but see nothing, having been previously
told by the Spectre that they should only hear and not see.</p>

<p>With a voice distinct from that of the living, so that none
of you can perceive the least manifestation of breathing, this
personal form tells you not to be afraid—that nothing will
hurt you—to stand as near as you please, and handle him
that you may know whether or not he is flesh and bones.
You comply with the request, and find no material substance.
Now what would be your conclusion? Would you feel sure
that these matters were all the effect of your own fancy and
that of others? Can you produce a single instance out of all
history, in which so many persons were thus impressed, while
in reality they saw and heard nothing? But suppose further,
that this Spectre informs you of events which you cannot
possibly know by other means, what then would be the
inference? “I make a distinction, says Doctor Johnson, between
what a man may experience by the mere strength of
his imagination, and what imagination cannot possibly produce.”
Thus, suppose I should think I saw a form and heard
a voice cry, “Johnson, you are very wicked—and unless you
repent, you will certainly be punished;” my own unworthiness
is so deeply impressed on my mind, that I might imagine
I thus saw and heard, and therefore I should not believe
that an external communication had been made to me. But
if a form should appear and a voice should tell me that a particular
man had died at a particular hour—a fact which I
had no apprehension of, nor any means of knowing, and
this fact, with all its circumstances, should afterwards be
unquestionably proved; I should in that case be persuaded
that I had supernatural intelligence imparted to me. By
this it appears, that had Doctor Johnson been an eye and ear
witness of only a small part of what is now to be related, he
would have believed that he had seen the form and heard
the language of a Spectre. “He had a very philosophical
mind, says Mr. Boswell, and such a rational respect for testimony,
as to make him submit his understanding to what was
authentically proved, though he could not comprehend why
it was so.”<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> And the same will be the disposition of every
pious and reasonable mind. But if you reject the evidence of
experience, the evidence of substantial testimony and the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</span>
evidence of predictions, where are you? On the billows of
scepticism, without a helm, and your lee shore is infidelity.</p>

<p>It is frequently asserted, and that by multitudes, that the
true origin of the following letters is a gross artifice. <span class="smcap">Asserted</span>
I say: for that is all. Twenty-six years’ time they
have had to look round, search and prove that they are not
mistaken. And for this purpose, means and pains have not
been wanting. Nothing however has yet transpired to make
good the assertion; but remarkable events have disproved it.</p>

<p>It is well known that some of the witnesses have been
prosecuted for mountebanks; but nothing even to form an
indictment could be found against them. Do I misrepresent?
Do I mislead the credulous? Then let me be convinced?
yea, let me be exposed. Let the cause be fully and
fairly tried by friendly discussion; not in a future century,
when we shall dwell in silence, but now, while the means of
evidence are at hand—while the witnesses and their opponents
are yet living.</p>

<p>If we love our neighbors, we prize their characters, and
forbear needless censure, especially in a case like this.
“Judge not that ye be not judged.”</p>

<p>For our conclusion, the words of the celebrated Mr. Addison
and of Mr. Hartly are not impertinent: “I think a
person who is terrified with the imagination of ghosts and
Spectres, much more reasonable than one, who, contrary to
the report of all historians, sacred and profane, ancient and
modern, and to the traditions of all nations, thinks the appearance
of Spirits fabulous and groundless. Could not I
give myself up to this general testimony, I should to the
relations of particular persons, who are now living, and
whom I could not distrust in other matters of fact.”<a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a>
“Certain it is, says Mr. Hartly, that Spirits can become visible
and converse with us, as man with man; and so innumerable
are the instances hereof, as also of their discoveries,
warnings, predictions, &amp;c., that I may venture to affirm with
an appeal to the public for the truth of it, that there are
few ancient families in any county of Great Britain, who
are not possessed of records or traditions of the same in their
own houses, however the prevailing Sadducism of these
times, may have sunk the credit of them.”—<cite>Preface to Swedenborg’s
treatise of heaven and hell, p. 18.</cite></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</span>
His whole discussion of this topic demands our peculiar
attention.</p>

<p>As the glorious descent of New Jerusalem is at hand, and
perhaps already begun, it is not improbable that henceforth
these phenomena will exceedingly multiply, and then destroy
the wisdom of the wise. New Jerusalem will descend,
i. e. the saints will descend from heaven and make visible
their spiritual bodies. While those heavenly doctrines are
inculcated, which establish a church new and glorious; so
that the old christian church has no glory by reason of the
glory which excelleth. Then Universalism, Socinianism,
Arianism, and the grossly absurd doctrine of Divine tri-personality
will deceive the nations no more for a thousand
years.<a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a></p>

<p>In reply to a friend, who had expressed his desire and that of others, that the
account of the Spectre might not be made public.</p>
</div>

<p><i>My Dear Sir</i>:—In our last interview, you favored me
with the suspense of your judgment with regard to the
Spectre, which has produced so much altercation in this
part of the land.</p>

<p>I am therefore encouraged to ask your further attention
to this affair, contemptible as it must appear, if you believe
but a part of the misrepresentation now propagated. These,
with modern incredulity, now form the general opinion of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</span>
the wise and unwise, the learned and unlearned, that this
whole affair is mischief and artifice, practised by one or
more of Mr. B’s family, and particularly by the young woman,
whose marriage was responsive to the prediction and
direction of the Spectre. Thus stands the vision of Hosea
in the view of our Deists. They consider it a thousand
times more probable that the good man was some how or
other deceived by those licentious women, than that he ever
received such direction from the invisible world. Now
while my own opinion is entirely the reverse—while I view
that family and their neighbors who vindicate them as unjustly
censured; shall I appear the sang froid spectator?
Perish rather my own reputation with theirs.</p>

<p>But this notwithstanding, dear sir, you will not fail to
mention the ardent sensations of gratitude and esteem which
I entertain for those pious and judicious persons, who have
expressed their generous anxiety for my character and
usefulness.</p>

<p>It is not so much the matter or style of the pious discourse
of the Spectre which demands our attention, as the enquiry
whether there was any Spectre or not. She taught the
same truth which we find in our Bible. She proclaimed no
new doctrine. Had she done this, it would have occasioned
a great objection against her.<a id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> She exhorted the young
people to read the Bible as their sure guide to eternal life.
And her requirements were defended by the Scriptures
whenever the propriety of any of them was doubted, to shew
that her directions agreed with the law and the testimony.</p>

<p>In the style of her discourse, there was nothing of elegance
or sublimity, more or less than we observe among
common people in that pious and familiar conversation in
which passages of Scripture are frequently introduced.</p>

<p>This, they say, is a great objection: a person from the invisible
state would never have conversed with the people in
such an ordinary style. But had she excelled in the <em>elegant</em>
or <em>sublime</em>, objection would not have been silent. It would
have been said that she was not the person she professed to
be: for the employment of that person had never been the
study of Sheridan or Longinus: on earth she was below it,
in heaven above it. The Spectre came not with the excellency
of speech, which man teaches, nor with the sublimity<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</span>
of those prophecies which describe the rise and ruin of
empires; for empires were not her subject; and there was
perfect propriety in her using such language as would subserve
two of her designs: which were to manifest who she
was, and to render herself as familiar as possible to those
common people with whom she conversed. Accordingly her
mention of certain articles of property which she had left,
was by no means an ultimate design, as she herself declared;
but this, and her reasonable disposal of them, were more
clearly to convince her family that she had been their
daughter and sister. For the same reason the features of
her face were observed to be like those of the person she
professed to be, by some who knew her in her life time.
And though her voice had no indication of breath and was
inimitably distinct from any voice of the living, yet it had
the same sound which she had uttered in her last hours, as
they, who attended her in her last sickness have testified.
Sometimes a part of the company could understand her
words without the least difficulty; while others with advantages
of hearing, every way equal, perceived only a sound,
without the least articulation whatever. Thus the men who
were with Paul at the time of his conversion, heard a voice,
but saw no man, and they saw the light, but heard not the
articulate voice of the speaker.</p>

<p>Such was the various experience of the people on these
occasions. Some of them heard and understood plainly,
but saw nothing: others heard a voice, but no speaking
voice: others again saw a light, but no person: while they
had no impediments natural or accidental; yet far the
greater number heard the words distinctly, and clearly
saw a personal form. And the very same persons,
who could not see, nor hear intelligibly at one time, would
at another time, and even at a greater distance see, hear and
understand without the least difficulty: while others of the
company, who had clearly seen and understood at the previous
interview, could now only see a light and hear a sound.</p>

<p>It was to render herself familiar that she frequently introduced
herself, as we do, by the token of knocking.</p>

<p>When Peter knocked at the house of Mary, the disciples
thought it was his angel, that is to say, they thought that a
Spirit might come to the house and knock. They more
easily believed that a Spirit was at the door, than that Peter
had escaped from prison. We should in this age more easily
believe the contrary. But the disciples were no philosophers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</span>
For the same reason she endeavored to dispel the fears of
those who conversed with her. “Do not be afraid,” she
would say, “I have not come to hurt you. You need not be
afraid at all.” Utterly opposite, you observe, to the conduct
of those who personate apparitions. They generally aim to
keep their dupes in fear and at a convenient distance.</p>

<p>So the angel addressed the shepherds, “Fear not.” “I
do not stand too near you, do I?” said a person unsuspected.
“No,” was the reply, “stand as near as you please.”</p>

<p>Hence also the reason why she did not commonly begin to
speak, till she was addressed. I say, <em>commonly</em>, for there
were some exceptions. The voice of a Ghost responsive, is
not so unexpected, and, of course, not so suddenly terrific
as the same voice would be without previous address. This
may serve to remove that objection of the Encyclopedia: “It
is an odd circumstance, say they, that ghosts have no power
to speak till they are addressed.” But this odd circumstance
is not occasioned by their want of power; but by
their tenderness for the persons who receive their messages.
This was the very reason she once expressly gave for not
speaking where she once appeared. Hence we may, if we
choose, see one reason why she spoke so frequently in the
cellar. It is easy to see, if we choose, that the idea of a
Spectre coming into the room where the family commonly
resided for labor, sleep, or other refreshment was distressing
to them: for this was their refuge, their place of retreat.
Accordingly when, upon a certain day, she appeared among
them in one of the lower rooms, they all left the house.
The Spectre, therefore, out of tenderness to them, <em>commonly</em>,
though not always, conversed in the cellar, that they
might seem to have a place of retreat. The next question
is, why then did she not commonly speak in one of the
chambers or in the open field? But the chambers were the
apartments of repose, and the field was inconvenient by the
weather. She did however, sometimes speak in the chambers,
and in the lower rooms, and in other houses of the
neighborhood, and several times in the open field.</p>

<p>A cellar, such as that was, is a place where deceivers, imitating
her realities would find difficulty. A ventriloquist
might indeed speak there. But how? Not so that a part of
the company shall hear and understand distinctly, while the
other part with advantages of hearing every way equal, and
giving equal attention, shall not understand a single word.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</span>
If a ventriloquist could perform this, we should have known
it before this time.</p>

<p>No white garments can appear white in a dark cellar at
midnight, and suppose any lucid substance could have been
used, then, when it first appeared a mere shapeless mass, who
formed it in a moment into personal shape, face and features?
Who caused it to speak and desired to be handled?
and when this desire was complied with, why did not the
hand undeceive the eyes? Now admit the possibility of a
magic lantern, where did it move, and where stood the upright
plane for the representation, when by the order of the
Spectre, the company of about twenty persons formed an
Ellipsis within which she passed and re-passed from end to
end several times. You must inform me too how some eyes
saw the form so clearly, while others with advantages of
sight every way equal, saw nothing.</p>

<p>However, it is not even pretended that any such mediums
of delusion were ever seen here.</p>

<p>For an argument which vindicates this conduct of the
Spectre still more, I am indebted to Professor Stewart. “It
appears to me to be no slight confirmation of these remarks,”<a id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a>
says he, “that, although in the dark, the illusions of imagination
are much more liable to be mistaken for realities, than
when their momentary effects on the belief are continually
checked and corrected by the objects which the light of day
presents to our perception; yet even total darkness is not so
alarming to a person impressed with vulgar stories of apparitions,
as a faint and doubtful twilight, which affords to the
conceptions an opportunity of fixing and prolonging their
existence by attaching themselves to something which is obscurely
exhibited to the sight.” Hence it follows, that in a
dark cellar at midnight, a person was not so much exposed to
deception, either by his own imagination, or by the artifice of
others, as if there had been some degree of light. Had the
ghost been wholly confined to a cellar, kitchen, or garret, or
even to all these, the objection would appear more plausible;
but this was by no means the case.</p>

<p>Accompanied by two persons she walked, or rather moved
in elevation from the ground, nearly two miles, discoursing
with them as they went along. “For what purpose?” you
ask. Doubtless an important one. But to what purpose could
I tell you; while you reject the possibility of it for any purpose.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</span>
This little journey was soon published through the town,
but was no more believed than this luminous age now believes
the writer. What was the consequence? “Go,” said
the Spectre, “to one of those two persons, collect all those in
the neighborhood, who give the best evidence of piety and
veracity. Let them hear and see: for they will tell the
truth.” He complied, and fifty people were convened at the
time and place appointed for the interview.</p>

<p>After conversing with them several hours on the most
serious topics, by which they were exceedingly affected and
delighted, she reminded them of their credulity, and informed
them that if they would walk on two and two in the solemn
order observed at a funeral, she would walk with
them, accompanied by one of those persons, who had accompanied
her before, for evidence that they might have declared
the truth. The company complied, and walked with her
about half a mile in the manner now described.</p>

<p>But after all, I hear you inquire, “<cite>admitting that the
whole affair is genuine and free from illusion, how can the
belief of it become beneficial to me and others?</cite>”</p>

<p>But certainly truth is better than error. And do we know
that this truth will never be wanted hereafter, for purposes
which do not at present appear? Do you know how soon
your own or other families may suffer unjust reproach, like the
family and vicinity who are now so liberally censured? Do
we know the length and weight of the chain of which this
link is a part?</p>

<p>The Scriptures teach the doctrine of the separate state,
and oppose materialism. What then? Is the evidence of
Scripture injured by other evidence declaring the same truth
and urging the study of the Scriptures, as our sure guide to
eternal life? The ancient medals and other monuments of
antiquity, which afford so much rational entertainment for
the curious, never diminish in their eyes the evidence of
value of the Roman, Grecian or Egyptian History. Why
then should this medal before us, diminish in our eyes the
value of the Scriptures? What distinction of men are they,
who stand most secure from the peril of illusion by the superstitious
belief of Spectres? Speak ye illuminees! ye
Paines who keep no Bible!</p>

<div class="smaller">

<p>The circumstances of the marriage related in vindication of Mrs. Butler
and others.</p>
</div>

<p><i>Dear Sir</i>:—To compare great things with small, the unbelieving
Jews, who heard and saw the first christian miracles
to be really such, viewing them as the effects of magic
or some other secret influence of satan; but modern infidels
say they were no miracles at all: so the opponents of the
Spectre in this place, who have heard and seen, generally
allow that the performances of the ghost were miraculous,
but accomplished by evil agency; while distant opponents pronounce
the whole an artifice.</p>

<p>Thus distance of place has occasioned the same variations
among the opponents of the Spectre, as distance of time
among the opposers of christianity. By this comparison you
must not imagine that I have reference to criminality; but
my design is to show that the friends and foes of the Spectre
in this place are both opposed by those distant people who
pronounce the whole an artifice. It is a mixture of supernatural
agency and artifice in the view of the opponents
here: not because the least motion of the latter was ever
really discovered; but because they judge, (and feel capable
of judging) that no case of marriage in any age of the
world, since the finis of the Scriptures, can possibly require
the interposition of an heavenly messenger.</p>

<p>We, on the contrary, are so poorly qualified to determine
how the world ought to be governed, that we know not
what events should take place by ordinary means, or what
by extraordinary means; and therefore we know not but
there might be such a circumstance in some place or period
of the world.</p>

<p>We are too as much at a loss to account for the advent of
an evil angel singing alleluias, in order to join a couple
mutually attached in a relation which is honorable in all;
as to account for the advent of an holy angel for the same
purpose.</p>

<p>It is necessary without all doubt, that such an extraordinary
dispensation should be connected with an important
consequence and a special reason why it took place. But it
is not necessary that this consequence and reason should at
present be universally known, though they certainly will be
known hereafter, and probably in part to many in this world.
The performances of the ghost are so connected with other<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</span>
events of Providence, as to form a connected whole, the
beauty of which cannot be known even in part without
much examination.</p>

<p>The Spectre had a number of extraordinary messages, of
which the marriage was but one, and that a subordinate
one; and accordingly did produce extraordinary credentials.</p>

<p>The very first notices of anything unaccountable were
given at the time when Mrs. Butler, the supposed authoress
of the whole delusion, was at the point of death, by a disease
which soon became external and proved its reality.
Was that the time for her, to commence the enterprise for a
husband, when she must have been under the greatest disadvantage
for the prosecution of it, and when there was no
rational expectation that she would ever need a husband?</p>

<p>About twenty-four hours after her marriage, the Spectre
foretold that she would become the parent of one child and
then die. For what purpose <em>could</em> she, or any person for
her, contrive this prediction and its fulfilment. Her walk
of two miles in company with the Spectre and her father,
was undertaken with great reluctance, if anything could be
known by the correspondence of words and behaviour. But
the small voice of one who had made the house tremble, informed
them by message, that lives were in danger, if they
refused. By the same voice the Scripture was quoted to
shew that her direction was not inconsistent with it. What
could have been done in this case more than was done by
the most pious or prudent on earth? The Scriptures were
consulted. The family prayed together, that, if there was
deception in this extraordinary injunction, the Lord would
make it known to them, and that, if the cause was of God,
they might be preserved: for the storm, the evening, and especially
the weakness of the ice, had rendered the way difficult
and very perilous. When to these considerations we
add the grievous offence and explicit repulse, which the
whole family had that day received from the person to whom
her father was, out of her hearing, to communicate the message,
we cannot admit the idea of artifice in Mrs. Butler,
without detaching from her all fear of danger—all sense of
resentment—all respect due from a child to the parent—all
rationality of conduct, and all consistency of character.</p>

<p>But further, the greatest and most conspicuous of these
miracles appeared after the marriage. Could she, would
she, or any person for her, perform these impossibles to obtain<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</span>
a purpose which was obtained already? But admitting
the plea for a minute, and but a minute, that they were
possibles intended to establish the farce and multiply dupes
for the preservation of character; a question then urges incessantly:
<em>For what purpose was the child dug up and buried
in another grave?</em> This was not a mere accident, but a deliberate
and public transaction, appropriated by no <em>pretence</em>
of any reason, but the mere order of the Spectre. Eighty
people from four different towns were assembled and offered
prayer to the Supreme Being on this occasion, and all by
the direction of the ghost, declaring that the child would
rise at her right hand at the last day. This was horrid
wickedness in the ghost, if she was only such by profession.
And our opponents must for their own sakes, allow that she
possessed a great degree of subtilty, if not of wisdom: since
for twenty six years past, they have for the most part scarcely
ventured to conjecture, much less to prove who she was;
though by their own acknowledgment she has talked among
twenty of them, from time to time, within a foot of their
faces.</p>

<p>Doubtless then some special design was concealed in this
rare transaction. What was it? The continuation and extension
of the fraud? No: for she must have known that
the least of those miracles already exhibited, would better
answer this purpose, were it now presented only before a
small part of these eighty people. But the reinterment was
not connected with even the pretence of miracle. What
was the consequent impression on the minds of mankind?
Just what any person with half an eye would easily foresee.
It was such as rendered Mrs. Butler’s character in the eye
of mankind, neither better nor worse. What could she
think to gain or lose in character or anything else, whether
that other woman’s child rested in its first grave, or in another
about thirty feet from it? The whole affair was considered
by mankind in general, as a solemn, mysterious parade,
without any apparent consequence of injury or utility.</p>

<p>But this practical oath, as already shewn, was not without
design: what was it? Was it to convince the assembly <em>at
that time</em>, that Mr. Blaisdel and <abbr title="Captain">Capt.</abbr> Butler, who acted the
most distinguished and solemn part in it; believed the Spectre
and her performance to be realities? No: for this they
were completely convinced already. The question therefore
with our opponents stands unresolved. When we consider<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</span>
too the inimitable sound of the voice, most nearly resembling
the dying voice of <abbr title="Captain">Capt.</abbr> Butler’s first wife, at certain
times: And how often the ghost has appeared since Mrs.
Butler’s death, all suspicion of artifice must be utterly
groundless, and cannot be indulged by those who love their
neighbors as themselves, and exercise that constant tenderness
for their characters which the gospel requires.</p>

<p>It has been objected against the Spectre, that in obtaining
parental approbation the mothers were not sufficiently respected.
But as the husband and wife are one, the message
to the father was virtually sent to the mother. It was necessary
in this case that three families should be consulted
by the Spirit; that which had been her own family and those
of the parties.</p>

<p>But with whom began this consultation? Not with Eve,
like that of the devil. She did not, like a deceiver, first
frighten and convince the timorous sex that they might assist
her, either to delude or afflict their husbands. No, her
conduct was fair and above-board. Her first application was
to the fathers of these families: What was it? Certainly
not that which is recommended by the Encyclopedia and the
ballad poem; but that of deliberation. She at first neither
appeared nor spake to them immediately to frighten them
into compliance at once; but as she had dealt with the son,<a id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a>
so she dealt with the fathers. She sent messages to them.</p>

<p>By this fair mode of conduct, they had opportunity to reflect,
to exercise reason—to consult one another, and to
watch and pray against deception. Her first message sent
only to the two fathers of this couple, contained that passage
in Mark 10: 2 to 9, by which they might learn that, as
the condition of ancient Israel at a certain time, required a
precept with respect to marriage, somewhat distinct from
the common law, which had existed from the beginning: so
now the condition of this little branch of society might, for
aught they knew, require a precept with respect to marriage,
somewhat distinct from the common regulation, which had
obtained from the beginning, though not contrary to it:
even as a by-law may be consistent with the public code.</p>

<p>Such, she declared, was the precept now revealed for the
particular regulation of those families, and her proofs to be
produced, were her miracles. A strange, unexpected, unheard<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</span>
of message indeed! But not more strange, unexpected,
or unheard of, than the credentials. By this precept she
declared the parties must and would be joined. “And what
God hath joined together let not man put asunder.”</p>

<p>The father of the young lady, who had ever been most obstinately
opposed to this connection, by whose means it had
been once interrupted already, and who was no less capable
than the other of discovering imposition, and ever watchful
against it; was the first who obtained conviction. Him the
Spectre sent to the other father (Mr. Butler) and his son to
declare this conviction, and that the latter must conduct accordingly.
The response was repulse, and he returned.</p>

<p>By the same extraordinary counsel, after praying and
reading for light, he went again, and his daughter with him,
crying and wringing her hands. After they had proceeded
a small distance, they were accompanied by the Spectre the
rest of the way, whose delightful voice uttering expressions
full of love and tenderness, consoled the daughter as they
went along.<a id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> This prepared her for acquiescence when coming
to the house of the Spectre, as decency required, directed;
that, while the daughter should tarry with her abroad,
the father should go in and tell Mr. Butler’s family that the
Spectre had come with them, and that, if they chose a miracle
for further confirmation, it should be granted.</p>

<p>After Mr. Butler had performed this, they invited the
daughter to come in, and the question of suspicion being
proposed, she solemnly protested, that if there was mischief
in hand, she was as ignorant of it as they were.<a id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a></p>

<p>Here we see what abundant opportunity was given them
to deliberate and consider for themselves in what way they
would choose to be convinced: whether by miracle or common
providence.</p>

<p>Message, protestation and miracle being rejected, Mr. Blaisdel
and his daughter returned without delay, but had no<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</span>
sooner reached home than a new order from the Spectre,
consistent with Scripture, required that Mr. Hooper, who
had been her father, and who lived about six miles off, should
be conducted here the next morning.</p>

<p>We now return to Mr. Butler’s family; not to see miracles,
but their confirmation by the voice of common Providence.</p>

<p>After Mr. Blaisdel and his daughter had left them, his
conduct was naturally the subject of their discussion; and
the more they reasoned, the more unaccountable it appeared.
His notorious and inflexible opposition to this connection,
which had continued several years, rendered him the
most unlikely person in the world to pass a river, now the
brink of death, for such a purpose. Their result was the
necessity of further advice, and they unanimously chose Mr.
Hooper, the young gentleman’s father in law, as the person
best qualified to give it. Accordingly the son, <abbr title="Captain">Capt.</abbr> Butler,
went the next morning to consult with him on this affair;
but to his great surprise found himself intercepted by messengers
sent by the ghost for the same purpose, who had just
finished their business with success. <abbr title="Captain">Capt.</abbr> Butler asked
what he should do. “The case is such,” said Mr. Hooper,
“that I can have no advice to give.”</p>

<p>Mr. Hooper, according to his promise, went off with the
messengers; discoursed with the Spectre, and by the tokens
which she gave him, identified his daughter.</p>

<p>After the deliberation of several days, he, by the desire of
the Spectre, went to Mr. Butler’s family, declared his conviction,
and closed the message by solemn exhortation.
Thus was the very man, whose advice they had preferred
to a miracle, qualified by the Spectre to give it.</p>

<p>But to recede: Mr. Hooper’s interview with the Spirit at
Mr. Blaisdel’s house was immediately succeeded by the arrival
of <abbr title="Captain">Capt.</abbr> Butler there. He soon acquired evidence that
the Spirit was that of his deceased wife, and declared that
her will was his.</p>

<p>But now to what purpose was all this labor and all these
messages? For Miss Blaisdel was then asked if the same
was her will? The reply was categorical and indignant; the
purport of which was, that if she must die for her refusal,
she desired to submit—that servile attentions, however miraculous
the compulsion, would afford no satisfaction to her—that
her trials were already intolerable by those false and
wicked calumnies, which her compliance would now invigorate<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</span>
and render her life more bitter than death. That her
attachment to his person was peculiar, she did not deny;
but his credulous attention to these calumnies had rendered
his society a burden.<a id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> At length, however, <abbr title="Captain">Capt.</abbr> Butler’s
unreserved and honorable confession, and his renewed assurances
that his <em>own</em> will was his, as well as that of his deceased
wife, did, with the words of the Spectre prevail.</p>

<p>The design of marriage was made public, and round her
increased the storm of accusation abroad, and opposition at
home. For, though her father had constant and unwavering
conviction that the precept was from heaven, it was only at
certain intervals that he enjoyed the least degree of reconcilement;
and it must not be concealed that <abbr title="Captain">Capt.</abbr> Butler
received very ill treatment from him.</p>

<p>Worn out by unjust reproaches abroad and these vexations
at home, she at last told <abbr title="Captain">Capt.</abbr> Butler, offering him a golden
token of her constant affection, that she could bear these
miseries no longer, and that they must separate. He pleaded
the impropriety of her conduct after such evidence that
the appointment was divine. His plea was the waste of
words. She dismissed him utterly and forever. This I had
by the favor of Capt. Butler himself. Here Mr. Blaisdel,
Mr. Butler, their families, their friends and every body else
had another fair opportunity allowed them by Miss Blaisdel
herself, to search, examine, reflect, deliberate and investigate
the deception, if there was any.</p>

<p>A vessel was now in the river, bound to a port about two
hundred miles from this place, where lived some of her near
kindred. Thither she was determined to go, and made
preparation for the voyage, that if possible she might find repose
on some distant shore. But the miraculous voice solemnly
warned her in the hearing of several witnesses, that her
efforts were vain, and that her affliction would sail with her.</p>

<p>By the direction of the Spectre given to one of those witnesses,
the dismissed was recalled. Not long after, the nuptials
were celebrated: and thus the Spectre obtained one of
those ends, which were only subordinate to other ends
of far superior magnitude and importance.</p>

<p>These superior ends you will know hereafter; but they
cannot—they must not be written.</p>

<br>
<i>Further evidence deduced from the appearances of the Spectre.</i><br>
</p>

<p><i>My Dear Sir</i>:—In compliance with your request, I proceed in
the argument that some persons among us have seen and conversed
with the dead. Of the five corporeal senses, only three are capable
of information by events of this nature. These are seeing, feeling
and hearing. To all these three senses, evidence has been addressed
in favor of the Apparition in this place. I would now contemplate
the evidence obtained by the senses of seeing and feeling.</p>

<p>The times, places and modes of her appearing were various.
Sometimes she appeared to be alone, as the events which followed
bore witness: for the testimony of events is sometimes more valid
than that of persons. Sometimes she appeared to two or three;
then to five or six; then to ten or twelve; again to twenty, and
once to more than forty witnesses. She appeared in several apartments
of Mr. Blaisdel’s house, and several times in the cellar. She
also appeared at other houses, and several times in the open field,
as already observed. There, white as the light, she moved like a
cloud above the ground in personal form and magnitude, in the
presence of more than forty people. She tarried with them till
after day-light, and vanished: not because she was afraid of the
sun: for she had then several times appeared when the sun was
shining. Once in particular, when she appeared in the room where
the family were, about eleven o’clock in the day, they all left the
house; but convinced of the impropriety of their conduct they
returned.</p>

<p>At another time, when several neighbors were at the house, and
were conversing on these remarkable events, a young lady in the
company declared that though she had heard the discourse of the
Spectre, she would never believe that there had been a Spectre
among us, unless she could see her.</p>

<p>In a few minutes after, the Spectre appeared to several persons
and said she must come in the room where the company was. One of
those who saw her, pleaded that she would not. The Spectre then
asked, “Is there a person here, who desires to see me?” The young
lady was then called, who, with several others saw the Spectre.
“Here I am, said she, satisfy yourselves.” The lady owned she was
satisfied. It was now about two o’clock in the day. In short the
ghost appeared or conversed, or performed both almost as frequently
in the day, as in the night.</p>

<p>But will christians argue that the appearance of an angel to the
Shepherds was a fiction because it happened in the night?<a id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</span>
In all the appearances of the Spectre she was as white as the
light, and this whiteness was as clear and visible in a dark cellar
and dark night, as when she appeared in the open field and in the
open day. At a certain time, August 9-10, 1799, she informed a
number of people that she meant to appear before them, (for she
frequently conversed without appearing at all) that they must stand
in order and behave in a solemn manner: “For the Lord,” said she,
“is a God of order.” Accordingly she appeared and vanished before
them several times. At first they saw a small body of light, which
continually increased till it formed into the shape and magnitude of
a person.</p>

<p>This personal shape approached so near to <abbr title="Captain">Capt.</abbr> Butler, that he
put his hand upon it and it passed down through the apparition as
through a body of light, in the view of six or seven witnesses.
There were now thirteen persons present, who all saw the apparition
except two.<a id="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> And five others, whether they were looking another
way, or were prevented by some standing before them, or whatever
might be the cause, did not see this attempt of handling the apparition.</p>

<p>But I attend to your reasoning. “If this extraordinary fact be
true, what a pity it is that there were no more witnesses! would not
the evidence have been greater had it been acquired by all the
eleven.” The more extraordinary the fact, the more numerous
should be the witnesses. This is the opinion naturally entertained
by mankind every where. Hence it follows that <em>all</em> of those eleven
persons were not then practising artifice: for then they would all
have seen this extraordinary fact.</p>

<p>The five who did not see it, saw that which was very little short
of it. They saw that which rose into personal form, face and features
in a moment. Returned to a shapeless mass in a moment,
resumed the person in a moment, and vanished again in a moment.
They saw that which was not <em>afraid</em> to be handled by them: For
she passed slowly by them near enough for that purpose.</p>

<p>The transfiguration of Christ was a very extraordinary fact. Out
of all his twelve disciples, why chose he only three to be eyewitnesses
of it?</p>

<p>As to the six witnesses, not one of them has ever been accused or
even suspected of being concerned in the supposed artifice. Some
of them are aged, others young. They had, and still have, professions,
employments and interests widely different and belong to four
different families. It is the fixed and settled opinion of our opponents
here, that two of them are not only persons of integrity, but
were ensnared by others through the whole scene.</p>

<p>These two persons soon after confirmed what they had now seen
and experienced by solemn, practical and most deliberate oaths in
the presence of eighty people. For one of them made a prayer at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</span>
the reinterment, expressing his belief of what he had seen, and the
other solemnly declared to all the assembly, as soon as the prayer
was finished, that this solemnity was ordered by the Spectre, to be
observed by his means. He also confirmed the same by an express
verbal oath before the civil magistrate.</p>

<hr class="tb">


<p class="center">
<span class="ls">LETTER <abbr title="Four">IV.</abbr></span><br>
<br>
<i>Evidence produced by the discourse of the Spectre.</i><br>
</p>

<p><i>Dear Sir</i>:—I would now present to your consideration the conversation
of the Spectre. But I shall first observe the objection
urged against some part of it.</p>

<p>At the time when she appeared to several persons at two o’clock
in the day, she said, she must come into the room, where the company
were; but was prevented by earnest entreaty. This, they say
was a falsehood.</p>

<p>At another time when she walked in company with forty people,
she went with them only to one house, though she had informed
them that she must go to two houses. She indeed went forward in
order to visit the other house, but was again prevented by earnest
entreaty. This was a fault like the other.</p>

<p>Observe a similar case in <abbr title="Genesis">Gen.</abbr> 19: 2, 3. “And he said, behold
now, my lords, turn in, I pray you, into your servant’s house, and
tarry all night and wash your feet; and ye shall rise up early and
go on your ways: and they said, <em>nay, but we will abide in the street
all night</em>. But he pressed upon them greatly, and <em>they turned in
unto him and entered into his house</em>.”</p>

<p>Several credible persons say, “she promised nearly fifty people to
convince them of her being such as she professed to be, if they
would comply with a certain condition. They complied, and went
off unconvinced.” But credible persons are sometimes mistaken,
and so, perhaps, they were now: because other persons, as credible
and as numerous, who stood nearer to and had better advantage of
understanding the voice, declare that it was not the Spectre, but Mr.
Blaisdel, who said that the company, by complying, would be convinced.
But he was mistaken. They went off, in general, unconvinced
at that time. The Spectre uttered but few words and withdrew.
This was the night of August 9, 1799. In that company
were the best of people, conducting in a sober manner; but others
uttered such profanity and derision as rendered them unworthy to
obtain conviction. On this account the Spirit afterwards declared
that she could not manifest herself among them. Christ himself, in
a certain place, could not do many mighty works because of their
unbelief. It is early enough to treat any affair with derision when
we have fully discovered what it is.</p>

<p>A scorner seeketh wisdom and findeth it not.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</span>
This company in general went off with the full persuasion
that the whole affair was mere legerdemain, and that the few
words of the Spectre, which they had heard, were only the
words of Mrs. Butler herself. Though they had been expressly
told by an unsuspected person, who held her by the
hand when the words were uttered, that she did not speak—that
the voice was at a distance from her. But they were
moderns, and the witness was rejected; and, as it was plainly
a different voice from that of Mrs. Butler, or any other that
ever they had heard, necessity, the mother of invention, produced
their hypothesis that Mrs. Butler had used some
sounding instrument.</p>

<p>But several of the company still remained at the house.
To them Mrs. Butler complained of the unjust reproach
which encompassed her. “What have I done,” said she,
“that I must suffer all this.” “Nothing, dear, you have
done nothing,” answered a voice immediately in the vacant
space of the room. Then about fourteen persons, by the direction
of the Spectre, went into the cellar. As soon as
they were there, the Spectre said to Mrs. Butler, “Go up
and sit with others on the kitchen hearth,<a id="FNanchor_20" href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> that this company
may know that it is not you who speaks.” After she was
gone up the ghost conversed with the company on several
topics, suited to authenticate her mission.</p>

<p>She mentioned several incidents of her past life, known
only to her husband, as he declared, and asked him if he
remembered them. He said, yes: she asked him if he had
told them. He answered, no: and of such a nature were
those incidents as to render it utterly improbable that he
ever should have mentioned them before. This was at the
time when he attempted to handle the apparition.</p>

<p>It is objected against her, that she told who was in heaven
and who was in hell.</p>

<p>She indeed mentioned the world of misery, as the eternal
portion of the finally impenitent; but I find not the least
evidence of her particularizing any person, or persons as
being in that miserable state.</p>

<p>She indeed mentioned several deceased persons as being
in a state of happiness: and who can prove the impropriety
of this? though indeed it is not what we should have expected.</p>

<p>Once when she conversed with about fourteen persons, Mr.
Blaisdel having heard that his father was sick, asked the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</span>
Spectre whether she knew any thing or not, concerning
him? “Your father,” she replied, “is in heaven, praising
God with the angels.” He afterwards found that his father,
two hundred miles distant, died seven days before this answer
of the ghost. True, the news might come from thence
in that interval. But his friends at York, where his father
lived, utterly deny that they sent the news in the course of
these days. Suppose however, the news did some way or other
come: could any deceiver, improving the circumstance,
know what questions Mr. Blaisdel would ask, so as to be
sure they could all be answered? Or was Mr. Blaisdel himself
in the plot? “No,” say our opponents, “his piety, his
veracity, and his utter aversion to the purpose of it, forbid
the suspicion.” It is therefore <em>probable</em> that the same creature,
who appeared and disappeared so often in the view of
the people, and could tell them where they should be and
what they would say and do in future time, was the true
author of this information.</p>

<p>At a certain time, when thirty people were convened to
hear her conversation, the name of a certain woman, who
was absent, happened to be introduced. “That woman,”
said the ghost, “has enjoyed a revival lately.” Immediately
one of the company went to her and asked what had lately
been the state of her mind. She related it to him, and he
told her that her information and that of the Spectre agreed.
Upon this she came and saw the Spectre; heard her conversation
for several hours, and expressed abundant satisfaction
and delight.</p>

<p>At the time when fifty people heard her discourse, while
more than forty saw her; to some of them, who had no
more believed these extraordinary events than mankind now
do in general, she mentioned several occurrences of her past
life known to them and her, but not divulged, in order to
satisfy them that she was the very person she professed to be.
Almost all this company had been acquainted with her in
her lifetime, and a considerable number of them very intimately.
She desired that any of them would ask what questions
they pleased, for the removal of any doubts respecting
her, which might exist in their minds. Accordingly certain
persons did propose several questions respecting a number
of events in her past life not divulged, which were so minute
and circumstantial as to render the hypothesis of their being
all so exactly rehearsed, as now to become the medium of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</span>
artifice, utterly absurd and irrational. To all these inquiries
she gave complete, satisfactory answers.</p>

<p>But not to detain you, I will now only ask, <em>How shall I
judge of these facts?</em> Shall I suppose that some artful girl
personating that deceased woman, could present herself before
forty people, well acquainted with that woman in her
lifetime? Tell them by a voice inimitable not to be afraid—to
stand as near as they pleased, and ask as many questions
as they pleased, and all without fear of discovery? What
subtle person would not be subtle enough to avoid such a
perilous situation?</p>

<br>
<i>The evidence deduced from her predictions.</i><br>
</p>

<p><i>Dear Sir</i>:—I must now ask your attention to the arguments
furnished by her predictions.</p>

<p>She foretold what the opinion and conduct of mankind
would be with regard to her, and the ill treatment which
Mr. Blaisdel’s family would receive on her account. She
not only declared the necessity, but foretold the certainty of
the marriage, at an hour when both the parties and both
their families opposed it, if there was any thing to be known
by the harmony of words and actions; yet the attachment
of the parties seems to have been mutual from first to last.
The pasara of the paradox is future: for mankind have more
than one character, and the alector of Æsop will despise
what a jeweller would prize.</p>

<p>She not only predicted the prosecution, but named a particular
person as one who would certainly be present at the
court for a witness, eleven months before these events took
place.</p>

<p>She named another particular person, as one who should
be present at the trial by the Grand Jury, and foretold what
kind of language he would utter in their presence, eleven
months before the accomplishment.</p>

<p>In about a month after, that is, ten months before the accomplishment,
an oath of its existence was given before a
magistrate. The person too, who is the subject of this prediction,
and fulfilled it, was never a friend, but invariably
the foe of the Spectre from first to last. She foretold to
forty people the issue of that trial, eleven months before the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</span>
accomplishment. To the genuine friends of literature in
this place, who were sincerely opposing superstition and
legerdemain, this prediction was made known.</p>

<p>They were warned of the disadvantage which they must
suffer, if they persisted.</p>

<p>They disbelieved the prediction, despised it, and became the
involuntary subjects of its fulfillment at the time appointed.
Within thirty hours after Mrs. Butler’s marriage, the Spectre
predicted that she would become the parent of but one child
and then die. Ten months after this her child was born, and
she died the next day. The safe return of one bound to the
West Indies was also foretold and accomplished.</p>

<p>These predictions are all fulfilled and were previously and
sufficiently known in this vicinity for evidence that they
<em>were</em> such. She uttered several other predictions now accomplished.
But as these events might possibly be foreknown
or strongly conjectured by other means, the mention
of them is omitted. Not only her words but her behaviour
too, manifested the spirit of prophecy. The reinterment of
the child was a practical oath, and never would have been
thought of but for her direction. Friends and foes were all
in one condition—all unable to conceive or even to conjecture
the design of it, till it was manifested eighteen months
afterwards, by certain, special, unexpected events of divine
Providence. If then we take an impartial and connecting
view of these and all the preceding evidences, how absurd
is the hypothesis that all these evidences could be the effect,
either of imagination or artifice! How much more rational
is the opinion which has obtained credit in all ages and nations,
that the spirit of deceased persons do sometimes appear,
however incapable we are of learning all the purposes
for which such events are designed!</p>

<p>By misapprehension and misinformation, piety and veracity
may give you an account very different from mine. But
ask those people of piety and veracity, who were present
when the greatest of these events took place, I tell you they
will not deny these facts. I am yours, &amp;c.</p>

<br>
<i>Miscellany.</i><br>
</p>

<p><i>Dear Sir</i>:—If the preceding arguments can be received,
perhaps you will not indulge distrust, if I subjoin something
of my own experience, confirmed by two other persons who<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</span>
saw the apparition in the same field in the same half hour.</p>

<p>Sometime in July, 1806, in the evening, I was informed by
two persons that they had just seen the Spectre in the field.</p>

<p>About ten minutes after, I went out, not to see a miracle,
for I believed that they had been mistaken. Looking toward
an eminence, twelve rods distance from the house, I
saw there, as I supposed, one of the white rocks. This confirmed
my opinion of their spectre, and I paid no more attention
to it. Three minutes after, I accidentally looked in
the same direction, and the white rock was in the air; its
form a complete Globe, white with a tincture of red, like
the damask rose, and its diameter about two feet.</p>

<p>Fully satisfied that this was nothing ordinary, I went toward
it for more accurate examination.</p>

<p>While my eye was constantly upon it, I went on four or
five steps, when it came to me from the distance of eleven
rods, as quick as lightning, and instantly assumed a personal
form with a female dress, but did not appear taller than a
girl seven years old. While I looked upon her, I said in my
mind, “you are not tall enough for the woman who has so
frequently appeared among us.” Immediately she grew up
as large and as tall as I considered that woman to be. Now
she appeared glorious. On her head was the representation
of the sun diffusing the luminous, rectilinear rays every
way to the ground. Through the rays I saw the personal
form, and the woman’s dress. Then I recollected the objection
of the Encylopedia, that, “Ghosts always appear to one
alone.” Now, said my mind, I see you as plainly as ever I
saw a person on earth; but were I to converse with you an
hour, what proof could I produce that I ever conversed with
you at all. This, with my fear, was the reason why I did
not speak to her. But my fear was connected with ineffable
pleasure.</p>

<p>Life, simplicity, purity, glory, all harmonizing in this celestial
form, had the most delightful effect on my mind.
And there appeared such a dullness afterwards upon all
corporeal objects as I never perceived before. I went into
the house and gave the information, not doubting that she
had come to spend some time with us, as she had before.
We went out to see her again; but to my great disappointment,
she had vanished. Then I saw one of the great errors
of my life. That I had not spoken to her has been the
matter of my regret from that hour to this.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</span>
My word without witness has not been tedious. Believed
or rejected, it may do you no harm.</p>

<p>On the more sure ground of attestation, I will now relate
some instances of her appearing or conversing, or performing
both in the day time.</p>

<p>Sometime in March, 1800, she talked a few minutes without
appearing, at eight o’clock in the morning, and promised
to come again that day. At two o’clock, performed her
promise, and talked with four people two hours. It was
then she uttered these words: “Though my body is consumed,
and all turned to dust, my soul is as much alive, as
before I left the body.”</p>

<p>This conversation was indeed in the cellar, but the place
was enlightened by her radiance.</p>

<p>May 21, at ten o’clock, she appeared to two persons, and
sent a message to another.</p>

<p>May 25, 10 o’clock. Appeared and conversed with two
witnesses, while a third person only heard the conversation;
and revealed that by which the same was proved to others.</p>

<p>May 26. She appeared at eight o’clock in the morning,
and talked with four persons an hour and a half. In half
an hour after, she appeared and talked with the same four
persons, while two others only heard a voice without knowing
what was said.</p>

<p>May 27. Talked with two persons, and promised to be
present at a meeting of about twenty people, which was to
be held the next day in the evening.<a id="FNanchor_21" href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> Accordingly she appeared
at this meeting to two other persons, who were ignorant
of the promise. The assembly were immediately interrupted
by the declaration, that “the spirit is come.” None
however, could distinctly see her, but those two persons.
The next evening after, she conversed with a third couple of
persons in company with the first two; mentioned her promise
as being fulfilled, and told them by her inimitable voice
to whom she had appeared. As a further confirmation that
she had been really present on this occasion; she did about
two months afterwards talk several hours in the midst of the
assembly of forty-eight people, while she was visible to two,
and only two, of that number.<a id="FNanchor_22" href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> These two people were a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</span>
fourth couple distinct from the other six. Such is the testimony
of these eight persons.</p>

<p>Her conversation was always with grace, seasoned with
salt, very affecting and delightful.</p>

<p>August 13, at 10 o’clock, she talked with three persons invisibly.
At two o’clock the same day, she appeared and
talked to three people in the hearing of five other persons.</p>

<p>Thus have you received a general, but very imperfect account
of these extraordinary events.</p>

<p>And now because a juggler will appear to check a musket
ball with the point of his knife, form animals, and perform
a thousand other idle wonders, will any lover of truth indulge
the inference that all the preceding phenomena are of
the same nature? Do these magicians reveal and establish
truths, the knowledge of which is of great importance to
certain persons now, and of public utility hereafter? No:
Their miracles are without meaning, and their design is pecuniary
profit, or else to shew what they can do to gratify
the vain curiosity of spectators.</p>

<p>Mountebanks do not <em>commonly</em> unite their employment
with religious order, prayer and praise, or with solemn admonitions
of life and death, blessing and cursing: Nor do
their idle exhibitions so harmonize with the common operations
of Divine Providence as that the former and the latter
have manifestly the same ultimate purposes. This harmony
is more than artifice can produce. Besides, who ever knew
an instance like this in view, which, with all its circumstances,
was afterwards fairly proved to be a deception?
And if mountebanks never did exhibit such a variety in such
circumstances, without the least partial discovery, we may
be sure they never could. For doubtless they have done all
they could do to impose on mankind by this species of
iniquity.</p>

<p>It would perhaps afford you some satisfaction to know
what other persons here would say respecting these transactions.
I shall therefore improve the first opportunity to send
you a copy of the oaths and attestations, which have been given
by those who favor the cause, and by those who oppose it.</p>

<p>I continue yours to serve for the promotion of truth.</p>

<p>The following pages, for brevity’s sake, present only the extracts from some
of the oaths and numerous testimonies of those who oppose and of those who
favor the cause. With all these witnesses I am intimately acquainted. I took
these testimonies from their lips, for the most part, separately. I wrote them;
read them in their hearing, and obtained their approbation of what I had written.
I made but little alteration in their language, because I chose that their
testimonies should appear in their own native simplicity. Therefore the philological
critic has no employment here. Among the testimonies of the opponents,
I have left nothing unextracted, which, in my apprehension, could seem
to afford any argument in their favor; or from which, to my recollection, they
themselves have ever deduced any argument for their purpose. If, however, I
have failed here or in any other respect, they will doubtless have opportunity to
make it known.</p>

<p>For the most remarkable occurrences, I have generally selected only two or
three witnesses, not for the want of more, by any means, but because the patience
of the reader must not be exercised by tedious repetition more than is necessary
for the present design.</p>

<i>Deposition of <abbr title="Captain">Capt.</abbr> Paul Simson.</i><br>
</p>

<p>About the first of August, 1800, Mr. H. and his wife came
to my house and desired me to go to Mr. Blaisdel’s with
them. After we got there, they said the Spirit sent for me.</p>

<p>I went down into the cellar, and soon after it rapped. I
asked what it wanted. It told me that I had done wrong;
I had become hard against her—that I had disbelieved. I
told her I had. She said that satan had tempted me and
that I had sinned. I asked her if she loved Christ. She
said, yes, I do. I told her the work of the saints was to
praise God. Yes, she said, and Christ too, and broke out in
singing alleluias.</p>

<p>At another time she ordered us to place ourselves two and
two, and she would follow us to <abbr title="Captain">Capt.</abbr> M’s, and ordered us
to sing a Psalm as we went. In going there I never saw
her. As we walked back, I walked behind. I looked back
and saw her. She appeared to me dressed all in white; as
bright a white as ever I saw, and had the appearance of a
woman and bigness.

</p>

<p>On August 7, Mr. Blaisdel came to my house and said the
voice had sent him for more witnesses, and that Mr. Simson
and I must go to his house. I was very much affrighted,
and could not think what he wanted. He said the Spirit had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</span>
sent him for more witnesses, and that I must go. I then
told him that Mr. Simson said the apparition had appeared
at our house the night before. My husband and I then went
with him. After we had been there some time, there was a
knocking—some spoke to her. She then asked if we wanted
to know who she was. It was answered, yes. She then said
three times, “I was once N—— B——.” There were many
questions asked, which she answered very directly. I asked,
are you from happiness or misery? To which she answered.
“I am from above, and am come on God’s message;” and
fell to singing alleluias.</p>

<p>After discoursing some time, she said she was going to
appear to us, and we must place ourselves two and two and
come into the cellar, and she would shew herself. We complied.
I was of the last couple who went into the cellar.
It was my desire not to see her. She said, those who did
not desire to see her, should not. I saw nothing. And
though she was so near to me, as I was told by P—— B——,
as that I could touch her if I had put out my hand, and I
looked to see her; yet, as I had said I did not want to see
her, I could not see her. I also, while in the field looked to
see her, yet I did not see her.

<p>The next deposition was given by one who looks upon the whole scene to be
a great deception, some how or other.</p>
</div>

<p class="center">
<i>The Deposition of Mr. Thomas Uran.</i><br>
</p>

<p>In August 11, 1800, I was at the house of A. Blaisdel. I
went on purpose to hear and see what I could concerning a
Spirit which was said to be there. In the evening there was
a knocking round the house; but nothing spake. We all
concluded there would be nothing said or seen. The next
morning about day-break, there seemed to be knockings
round the house, and in the chamber, and round my bed.
We immediately got up, and going down I took a candle,
lighted it, and went into the cellar alone, examining if there
was no one there to deceive us. I could not see any body.
I came back. Mr. Blaisdel, with all in the house went down
cellar—we heard a knocking. Some one spake in the name
of God, and asked what she wanted. She asked if we wanted
to know who she was. We answered, yes. She told us
she was once N—— B——. She then said to me, “you
have often said that I am a devil or a witch.” I then asked<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</span>
her, if she was from the God of heaven or from misery. She
answered, “I am from above, praising God and the Lamb;”
she then broke out in praise. She then told us that she had
come to warn us from sin, and that if there was not a
change before the soul left the body, we should be forever
miserable. She then told us the danger a sinner was in, out
of Christ, and told us that she should rise in the day of
judgment against us. I told her I had a great desire that
she should appear. And then she appeared to us all who
had a desire to see her.</p>

<p>She appeared like a person who was wrapped in a white
sheet, appearing and disappearing several times. It was
near sun rise at this time.</p>

<p>She then told us that was the day that Christ rose from
the dead, and that it was God’s precious time, and must be
kept unto him.</p>

<p>Lydia, (Mrs. Butler) was not in the cellar while the foregoing
talk was. The Spirit asked me if I would not clear
Lydia; I answered I would, for it was not she who talked.

<p class="center">
<i>Deposition of <abbr title="Captain">Capt.</abbr> George Butler.</i><br>
</p>

<p>When I was called to talk with this voice, I asked, “who
are you?” It answered, “I was once your wife.” The voice
asked me, “Do you not remember what I told you when I
was alive.” I answered, “I do not really know what you
mean.” The voice said, “Do you not remember I told you
I did not think I should live long with you. I told you that
if you was to leave me I should never wish to change my
condition; but that if I was to leave you, I could not blame
you, if you did.”</p>

<p>This passed between me and my first wife, while she was
alive, and there was no living person within hearing, but she
and myself, and I am sure that this was never revealed to
any person, and no living person could have told it to me
before the voice did. As Lydia (Mrs. Butler) and I stood
side and side alone,<a id="FNanchor_23" href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> she had her left arm round me and her
right hand hold of the forward part of my waistcoat, her
head leaning against my breast. There was something appeared
to my view right before me, like a person in a winding
sheet and her arms folded under the winding sheet, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</span>
on her arm there appeared to be a very small child. By
this appearance I did not know possibly but I might be deceived.
I reached out my left hand to take hold of it. I
saw my hand in the middle of it, but could feel nothing.
The same evening it appeared and disappeared to me three
times.

TESTIMONY <abbr title="One">I.</abbr><br>
<br>
<i>Testimony of Miss H. G.</i><br>
</p>

<p>August 9, 10. I was at the house of Mr. Blaisdel, by the
persuasion of others; for as to myself I made very light of
the matter, supposing that the whole was the contrivance of
certain persons, and I believe still that nothing good appeared
there.</p>

<p>We heard rappings, and these sounds were spoken to,
but no answer obtained. After much altercation (which is
needless to rehearse) we all came out of the cellar, and all
went off, except a few persons, of whom I was one. Some
of Mr. Blaisdel’s family uttered severe expressions against
those who went off and did not believe. “What do you
want they should believe,” said I; “for my part I see nothing
to believe.” Immediately Mrs. Butler came in from
the entry very much affrighted, “If any one desires to be
convinced,” said she, “let him look there in the entry.” I
looked there and saw nothing. Soon after this, while Mrs.
Butler was sitting on the foot of a bed, we heard a sound
right against her on the outside of the house. Mr. Butler
told her to speak to it. At first she refused. They told her
she must. Then she said to it, “If I am guilty stay away;
if I am clear in the name of the Lord clear me.” The Spirit
then rapped very hard, so as to shake the house. Some
of the company said she must go into the cellar. “So I
must,” said she; “if I do not, she will come into the room:
and if she does, I shall die.<a id="FNanchor_24" href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> Who will go with me.”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</span>
D—— A—— said she would go. They went,<a id="FNanchor_25" href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> and soon
after we all went down. Then I plainly heard the voice say
to Mrs. Butler, “Go up, that the people may not think it is
you who speaks.” I saw her go up into the room, and
heard at the same time the voice in the cellar. Mr. Blaisdel
asked the Spirit whence she came. She answered, “I
am from heaven. I am with God and with Christ—angels
and seraphim, praising God. Glory, glory, glory.” Mr.
Blaisdel asked why she did not manifest herself in the fore
part of that night to all the people. She answered, “I was
not permitted to come where there was so much sin.” The
Spirit then said to Mr. Blaisdel, “Ask the people if they are
convinced.” He did so; and I among the rest answered
that I was. But I think otherwise now. God knew who
would be there the forepart of that night. Why did he send
her? Then the Spirit said, “I must appear;” and by her
direction we placed ourselves in order. Then I saw a white
appearance, at first not more than a foot in height, but it
appeared larger and larger, and more plainly, and when it
came nearer to me, I was struck with fear and left the cellar;
but others told me that afterwards they saw the Spirit
plainly.</p>

<p>August 13-14, I again went to Mr. Blaisdel’s with forty-seven
persons. The Spirit now told us again that she was
from heaven, and that she was once N—— H——. After
much conversation the Spirit said that some of the people were
faint, and could not hear all that was to be said, and that
we must go up and refresh ourselves. “You must go with
me to two places this night,” said she, “and you must be
ready at one o’clock.” “What o’clock is it now,” said Mr.
Blaisdel; she said, “twelve, twelve, twelve.” We went up
immediately and looked on the watch, and it was exactly
twelve. In a short time, hearing the usual sign, we returned.
Among many other words which I do not remember,
Mr. Downing asked the Spirit if she knew him; she answered,
“yes,” and called him by name. He asked if she was
ever at his house. She answered that she had been once
there with her mother. At length she told us that we must
go up and she would walk with us behind, with Mrs. Butler.
But you must walk in order, two and two, said she, singing
a Psalm: for God is a God of order. Some person asked
when she would be ready. She said, “I will let you know.”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</span>
Some person again asked what o’clock it was. She answered,
<em>one</em>. We went up and again looked on the watch and it
was <em>one</em>. We attended prayer, and immediately after she
knocked. A Psalm was chosen, which the greatest number
of us could best remember, and it was sung as we walked.
I was now far forward and did not see the Spirit. When
we came to <abbr title="Captain">Capt.</abbr> Millar’s, the Spirit rapped there, and <abbr title="Captain">Capt.</abbr>
Millar with <abbr title="Captain">Capt.</abbr> Paul Blaisdel and some others, went into
the cellar, and I heard them talk, but could not understand
what was said to them. Then word came to us that we must
stand out in the field before the house—that she would appear
before us, and walk with Mrs. Butler, that the people
might be convinced that Mrs. Butler had told the truth in
relating that she had walked with her before. Then we all
stood before the house. Mrs. Butler put on a black cloak,
and when she had walked a little distance from us, as before
directed by the Spirit, I heard her groan bitterly, and soon
after I saw the appearance of a woman in white, walking
with her. Suddenly Mrs. Butler sung a part of that hymn
called New Jerusalem. Then she came to us and we all
went back in order to Mr. Blaisdel’s. I then looked back
and saw a person in white walking with Mrs. Butler. After
we returned to the house, Mrs. Butler appeared very weary
and exhausted. I asked her at what time the Spirit came
to her. She told me it was after she had walked a little
distance from the people. “When you heard me groan,
said she, then I saw it coming toward me. I am always
more afraid when I only see it, than I am after it has spoken
to me:<a id="FNanchor_26" href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> and she now told me not to be scared; that she
was not come to hurt me, and that if I would sing a hymn,
it would expel my fears.”

TESTIMONY <abbr title="Two">II.</abbr><br>
<br>
<i>Testimony of Mr. Paul Simson, <abbr title="Junior">Jun.</abbr></i><br>
</p>

<p>August 9, 1800. I was at Mr. A. Blaisdel’s, with many
more, and heard the sound of knocking. It was addressed,
and a voice answered, but I could not understand it. Several
persons spoke, but received no satisfactory answer. The
people generally concluded that the whole affair was some
deception. Therefore they went off and I among them.
But my reflections on that singular knocking, induced me
to say to two young men, “If you will go back, I will, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</span>
find out something more, if possible; for I am no more satisfied
now, than I was before I went to that house.” We
went back. Mr. Blaisdel asked us why we returned. I told
him that we had all gone off with the opinion that the whole
affair was a scheme contrived by his daughters, and nothing
more, and I meant if possible, to find them out. “You
must think as you please,” said he, “I am clear, and I believe
my family is.” I told him I wished to see all his family
sitting in one part of the room. They complied. Then
I took a candle and stood in the midst of the room. After
several minutes, something rapped near where two of us
stood, and from thence removed to several parts of the house.
“What do you think of it,” said Mr. Blaisdel? “It appears,
said I, to be strange.” “We will go into the cellar,” said
Mr. Blaisdel, “and, if you think any body is there, search
the cellar through with a candle;” we did so. I came out
last and was careful and watched, so that I was sure that no
person went down. Also the outer door was fast. Then
again we heard the sound of knocking. It was addressed,
and conversation followed, in the midst of which Mr. Blaisdel
said to me, “If you think any living person talks, go
forward and grasp that person.” I went forward a few
steps, but was so convinced that no body was there, that I
considered all further attempts as useless.</p>

<p>After much discourse, which I cannot remember, the
Spirit told us that we must go up and come down again in
order, two and two, and she would appear to us. We did
so, and I saw the apparition at first about two feet in height;
but, as it drew nearer to me, it appeared as tall as a person.
I saw this appearance passing <em>close by me and from me five
or six times</em>. At last it diminished to about a foot in height
and then vanished.

TESTIMONY <abbr title="Three">III.</abbr><br>
<br>
<i>Testimony of Miss Sally Martin.</i><br>
</p>

<p>August 13, 1800, I was at Mr. Blaisdel’s house, with more
than forty people, besides their own family, and heard knockings.
We all wondered, when we heard a sound on one
side or corner of the house; the next sound on the opposite
side or corner, and a third sound equally distant from the
second, and so on for a number of sounds, while the succession
was as rapid as one sound could be clearly distinguished<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</span>
from another. We were sure that no person, nor even
several persons, could make sounds so distant from each
other in such quick succession, even were it possible for
them to be in or near the places of these sounds, without
discovery. By the desire of the Spirit and Mr. Blaisdel, we
went into the cellar. Mr. Blaisdel told the people to stand
back and give the Spirit room, and not crowd so near her,
“don’t crowd her,” said he, “she cannot talk if you crowd
her.”</p>

<p>When we were placed, Mr. Blaisdel ordered the candle to
be blown out, and stood before the company next to the
Spirit.<a id="FNanchor_27" href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> When these things were done, the affair was become
as dark to me, as the cellar was. I heard much conversation
with several people by a voice which I never heard
before. This voice at last told us to go up and go to a certain
house and she would go with us. We did as the voice
told us: and, as we went, I saw a personal form, as white as
any thing could possibly appear, walking by Mrs. Butler’s
side, with locked arms. When we came to the only outer
door of the house, I saw this form at a distance from me,
abroad, though near the house, I went in and heard a knocking
immediately under the floor. In two or three minutes
I heard the same voice that I had heard before, talking with
<abbr title="Captain">Capt.</abbr> Millar.</p>

<p>By the desire of the voice, we stood before the house that
she might appear to us. There I saw the personal form as
plainly as ever I saw a living person: and I saw the same
form vanish before me in a moment.

liable to be deceived two ways: by the appearance of truth where it is not, and
by the appearance of deception where it is not.</p>

<p>Did not such an occasion as this require order? The Spectre was about to
communicate to the assembly an important message. Could they enjoy the
best advantage to hear and attend to it, while they were changing places,—crowding
and interrupting one another? Is not a voice better understood by
any auditory, if there be some intermediate space between the speaker and hearer?
What did they want a candle for, unless they wanted to be deceived? The
Spectre was white; so is a deceiver by a candle. The Spectre told them the
exact time of night; so could a deceiver by a candle. Did they want a candle
in order to see her? They had learned, or might have learned already, that she
could make herself as visible without a candle, as any person living could with
it. Four nights before this, she appeared to fourteen persons in this very place,
and six persons saw the hand pass through the apparition.</p>

<p>Two nights before this, she appeared to about twenty people, forming an
ellipsis, within which she slowly passed round so near the circumference several<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</span>
times, that every one of them might have handled her with deliberation, and
she had also expressed her desire to give satisfaction by this experiment.</p>

<p>Therefore it was not because she was afraid to be seen or handled, that Mr.
Blaisdel made this arrangement; but for reasons possibly unknown to us. But
<em>probably</em> one of them was this: On the night of this testimony, August 13, it
was one design of the Spectre to confirm what was past, by conducting as she
had before, May 28.<a id="FNanchor_28" href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> That is: by appearing only to two or three persons,
while to all others in the assembly, though conversing with her, she should remain
invisible. This, we are assured, by testimony 11 and 14, part 2nd, was
now performed. On the above May 28, a third person thought he saw her, but
was not sure; for he supposed he might be deceived by some change of the
candle light.</p>

<p>Hence we easily see that those two persons who saw her on this night of August
13, while she invisibly discoursed with the assembly, obtained more satisfaction
for others, if not for themselves, that what they saw was reality, than if
there had been a candle; especially if we consider that several women of the
assembly were dressed in white.</p>

<br>
<i>Testimony of <abbr title="Captain">Capt.</abbr> James Millar.</i><br>
</p>

<p>August 7. Mr. Blaisdel came to my house and desired
me to go to his own, where I might hear and see for myself.
He also went to <abbr title="Captain">Capt.</abbr> Samuel Simson’s with the same request.
<abbr title="Captain">Capt.</abbr> Simson and his wife, S—— B——, and N——
G——, who were there, came with him to my house, and we
all went to Mr. Blaisdel’s. When we had been there some
minutes, <abbr title="Captain">Capt.</abbr> Simson, by desire, prayed. His prayer was
immediately followed by a knocking, and we all went into
the cellar. Mr. Blaisdel asked what was wanted, and who
it was. It answered, “I was once N. H.” I asked, “How
was man made?” “Out of the dust,” said the voice, “Dust
thou art, and unto dust thou shalt return. You have the
Bible, and that is God’s truth, and do you abide by it. Love
God and keep his commandments.” After some conversation
with Mrs. Simson and others, she said, “I must go,”
and we heard no more. It was now broad day-light, the
outer cellar door being open, and utterly impossible that any
living person should be there, but those whom we could see
and know. The voice was about six feet from me.</p>

<p>August 9. I went to that house with many people, among
whom I observed much disorderly behaviour. The Spirit
spake but little, and I returned with a resolution to go no
more to that house on such an errand.</p>

<p>August 14. Just before day-light, I heard singing, as I
lay in bed, approaching to my house. Presently, by my
leave, my house was filled with people, and I heard knockings<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</span>
on the floor. By the desire of certain persons, I went
into the cellar with <abbr title="Captain">Capt.</abbr> P—— B——. After some discourse
of the voice with him, which I understood not, I
heard sounds of knocking near me. I asked, what do you
want of me. It answered, “I have come to let you know
that I can speak in this cellar as well as in the other.<a id="FNanchor_29" href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> Are
you convinced?” I answered, “I am.” “Now,” said the
voice, “the company must be solemn and stand in order before
your door, I am going to appear. Now do you remember
that I was once <abbr title="New Hampshire">N. H.</abbr>” We went up and complied with
her direction, and I saw a personal shape coming toward us,
white as the light. By the Spectre’s order, as I was informed,
Mrs. Butler went toward her. “Lydia,” said the Spectre,
“you are scared. You must sing.” Then she sung an
hymn. The Spirit came almost to us; then turned, and
Mrs. Butler with her, and went several rods towards <abbr title="Captain">Capt.</abbr>
Simson’s and appeared to take her by the hand to urge her
on further; and disappeared in our sight.</p>

<p>Mrs. Butler returned and informed the company, as I was
told, that if they would walk to Mr. Blaisdel’s solemnly as
to a funeral, the Spirit would walk with Mrs. Butler behind
them. The company did so. But I being far forward, saw
nothing. Mrs. Butler had expressed her unwillingness to
go to <abbr title="Captain">Capt.</abbr> Simson’s, and was excused, as she afterwards
told us.

TESTIMONY <abbr title="Five">V.</abbr><br>
<br>
<i>Testimony of Mrs. M. G.</i><br>
</p>

<p>On the 4th of August, 1800, about two hours before day-light,
while I slept in Mr. Blaisdel’s house, I was waked by
the sound of knocking. I got up, and with about twenty
others went into the cellar. There I heard such a voice
speaking to us as I never heard before nor since. It was
shrill, but very mild and pleasant.</p>

<p>Mr. Blaisdel, in addressing the voice, said that several
persons, (of whom I was one) had come from a distance to
obtain satisfaction, and desired that she would tell us who
she was, and the design of her coming. She answered, “I
was once N. H. and after I was married, I was N. B.” After
much conversation upon the design of her coming, she
appeared to us. At first the apparition was a mere mass of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</span>
light: then grew into personal form, about as tall as myself.
We stood in two ranks about four or five feet apart. Between
these ranks she slowly passed and repassed, so that
any of us could have handled her. When she passed by me,
her nearness was that of contact; so that if there had been
a substance, I should have certainly felt it. The glow of
the apparition had a constant tremulous motion. At last
the personal form became shapeless—expanded every way,
and then vanished in a moment.</p>

<p>Then I examined my own white gown and handkerchief,
but I could no more see them than if they had been black.</p>

<p>Nothing more being now seen or heard, we were moving
to go up, when the voice spake again and desired us to tarry
longer. We did so, and the Spirit talked with us another
hour, even till broad day-light. She mentioned to us the
ill treatment which Mr. Blaisdel’s family had suffered by
reproach and false accusation, and told us that they would,
on her account, be more despised and ridiculed in time to
come, than they had been already.</p>

<p>Her discourse concluded by a solemn exhortation to the
old, the middle aged and the young. The present life, she
said, was but a moment, in which we must be renewed or be
miserable forever.</p>

<p>In her address to the youth she observed that it was now
the Lord’s day, and that we must retire to our homes, read
the Bible, pray and keep the day holy. It was then she uttered
these lines of Dr. Watts.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent0a">“This is the day when Christ arose</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">So early from the dead;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Why should I keep my eyelids closed,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And waste my hours in bed?”</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>After speaking much more which I cannot remember, she
sang praises and left us.</p>

<p>Her notes were very pleasant. Her words were in no
higher style than common, yet were they exceedingly impressive.

TESTIMONY <abbr title="Six">VI.</abbr><br>
<br>
<i>Testimony of Mrs. Sally Wentworth.</i><br>
</p>

<p>On the 2d of January 1800, Hannah Blaisdel came to Mr.
Butler’s house and informed me that the extraordinary voice
which they had heard, had declared itself to be that of my
sister, and that I must go to her father’s house.</p>

<p>I told her to her face that I did not believe it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</span></p>

<p>The next day I received the same message by three other
persons, two of which belonged to two other families, and
returned the same answer. Nevertheless, to give satisfaction,
<abbr title="Captain">Capt.</abbr> Butler, Mr. Wentworth and I went with them to
that house. <abbr title="Captain">Capt.</abbr> Butler and I examined the cellar with a
candle, and in a few minutes after, Lydia and I went down
there. <abbr title="Captain">Capt.</abbr> S——n and some others, went with us, but
none of them stood before us. While I held Lydia by the
arm, we heard the sound of knocking. Lydia spoke, and a
voice answered, the sound of which brought fresh to my
mind that of my sister’s voice, in an instant; but I could
not understand it at all; though it was within the compass
of my embrace, and, had it been a creature which breathed,
it would have breathed in my face, and I had no impediment
of hearing. But Lydia told me that it said, “We
must live in peace and be united.” Then we came up. But
<abbr title="Captain">Capt.</abbr> S——n with Lydia and others, went down again. I
passed through the room which led to the cellar into another
room, and there I was much surprised when I plainly understood
by the same kind of voice, still speaking in the cellar,
these words, “I am the voice of one crying in the wilderness;”
and other sentences, which I cannot remember.
This is testified by several others who were with me.<a id="FNanchor_30" href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a></p>

<p>From this time I cleared Lydia as to the voice, and accused
the devil.</p>

<p>August 8, I was there again with about thirty others, and
heard much conversation. Her voice was still hoarse and
thick, like that of my sister on her death bed,<a id="FNanchor_31" href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> but more
hollow. Sometimes it was clear, and always pleasant. A
certain person did, in my opinion very unwisely, ask her
whether I was a true Christian. The reply was, “She thinks
she is, she thinks she is. She is my sister.”</p>

<p>August 13-14, I heard the same voice in the same place,
and did then believe it was that of my sister. She talked
much with <abbr title="Captain">Capt.</abbr> S——n, and exhorted the people. Mr.
Sp——r asked her if I believed that she was my sister. The
answer was, “She believes now.” By the direction of the
Spirit we went to <abbr title="Captain">Capt.</abbr> M——r’s, but I never saw her.</p>

<p>Sometime after this, Mr. Butler brought to me from the
Spectre, the private conversation which I know I had with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</span>
my sister in her lifetime, at a certain hour, when we were
alone together, and which he declares he never knew before;
as a token that I was her sister. It is true I had never revealed
it to any person, and I do not believe that my sister
ever did; but could not some evil spirit hear that conversation,
and afterwards personate my sister, and reveal it to
<abbr title="Captain">Capt.</abbr> Butler? For what purpose should my sister become
visible to us?—There was certainly no dispute nor difficulty
in my father’s family or that of Mr. Butler’s, which could
be any reason for her coming.

SALLY WENTWORTH.</span>
</p>
<br>

<div class="smaller">

<p>Mrs. Wentworth had now an opportunity to hear the voice of Lydia and the
voice of the Spectre in the same time and place, that she might have the best
advantage to judge whether or not there was the least agreement between them.
And that Lydia had never learned to utter two voices in the same minute, the
one her natural voice, the other the dying voice of this woman’s sister, appears
from the certainty that through all the time of the Spectre’s last sickness and
death, Lydia was two hundred miles distant from her.</p>

<p>When Mrs. Wentworth heard in the east room that sentence of the ghost,
“I am the voice of one crying in the wilderness;” this was the only time in
which the ghost uttered these words for that day, as several witnesses (nem.
con.) declare. Hence it follows that this was the exact minute when Captain
Simson, in the cellar, within eight feet of the voice, and free from deafness,
heard only a sound, while they who stood by him understood the words plainly.
(Compare this with a sentence in <abbr title="Testimony">Test.</abbr> 4, <abbr title="Second">2d</abbr> part.)</p>

<p>The reality of the token appears from the undoubted veracity of Mrs. W.,
her inflexible opposition and the oath of <abbr title="Captain">Capt.</abbr> Butler, the reputed dupe of the
whole business.</p>

<br>
<i>Testimony of Mr. Jeremiah Bunker.</i><br>
</p>

<p>On August 9, 1800, I went to Mr. Blaisdel’s, where there
were about twelve people.</p>

<p>After hearing the discourse of the Spectre, she appeared
before us and disappeared several times. She came close by
me and three or four others several times, so that each of us
could have handled her. The personal shape, when it disappeared,
first changed to a substance, without form, and
then vanished in a moment where it was: and after a short
space, the full personal form appeared again in a moment.
These changes I observed several times. I thought then and
ever since that the whole was a deception. For I cannot see
how there could be such a clear personal shape, where no
living person was. She was in the shape of a person as
much as any person could be.

TESTIMONY <abbr title="One">I.</abbr><br>
<br>
<i>Testimony of Mr. Abner Blaisdel.</i><br>
</p>

<p>May 29, 1800. The Spectre conversed with three of my
family. To dispel their fears, she introduced her conversation
by these words: “I have come again,<a id="FNanchor_32" href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> be not afraid, I
will not hurt you, I did not come here to hurt you, I am a
friend to you all.” One of them answered, “I cannot help
being afraid.” “You need not be,” said the Spectre, “you
need not be. I never did hurt you, did I?” No: it was
answered: “And I shall not hurt you,” said the Spectre.
“Put your things in place.<a id="FNanchor_33" href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> Conduct as formerly: for
nothing will hurt you.”</p>

<p>To <abbr title="Captain">Capt.</abbr> Butler the Spectre said, “Be kind to your wife:
for she will not be with you long. She will have but one
child and then die.” It was now that the Spirit sent a token
to Mrs. Hooper, her mother, by which Mrs. Hooper declares
she must have been her daughter.</p>

<p>August 6. I had for some time heard that my father was
sick, but had since received no news from him. I ventured
to ask how my father did; “He is in heaven,” said she,
“praising God with the angels.” I afterwards found by
other means, that my father died seven days before this.
He lived two hundred miles from me.</p>

<p>When she left us at this time, the voice sounded in the
air further and further from us, uttering these words: “I
am in heaven, praising God and the Lamb with angels, archangels,
cherubim and seraphim. Glory, glory, glory to God<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</span>
and the Lamb. I am going, I am going, I am going to Christ.”</p>

<p>August 8. About thirty people came to my house. That
night the Spectre had much solemn conversation with them
on religious subjects. Mr. N. H——n expressed his desire
to handle her, and she gave him liberty. Some times the
inimitable voice would sound ten or twelve feet from us,
then close to our face, then again at a distance: and these
changes were instantaneous. After broad day-light, the
outer door being open, when we could plainly see each other,
the voice spake to all, and said, “Let any one who pleases,
come and handle me: for Christ says that a spirit hath not
flesh and bones.”</p>

<p>Some person then said to Mr. H——n, “Now if you want
to handle her why don’t you go?”</p>

<p>Then he crowded through the people to the place where
the voice was still speaking, and said, “I find nothing here
to handle.”</p>

<p>August 9, 1800. We placed ourselves in order, according
to the direction of the Spectre; and a white appearance, at
first very small, rose before me and grew to a personal stature
and form. It stood directly before <abbr title="Captain">Capt.</abbr> Butler, while
he and his wife stood beside each other. I saw him put his
hand on the apparition, and I saw his hand pass through it.
Then it vanished. There were now about twelve persons
here.</p>

<p>On August 11, she discoursed with about twenty persons,
of whom I was one. “I come,” said she, “to warn you
against sin, and if there is not a change before the soul
leaves the body, you will be forever miserable.”</p>

<p>After the Spirit had spoken many things of this nature,
Mr. U. expressed his desire to see her, “You shall see me,”
said she, “I will appear to you all.” She appeared and disappeared
before us several times, and talked while she appeared.
She came close to us, and some said they saw the
child in her arms. My son P. observed it, and said, “Her
child is now in her arms;” “So it is,” said she, “so it is.”</p>

<p>When it was day-light, she told us that this was the day
when Christ rose from the dead—that it was God’s precious
time and must be kept holy, and that she must return to
carry on the work of praise, and then sang praises and left us.</p>

<p>Next morning, while I was at work in my field, I was told
that the Spirit had sent for me. I went into my house,
heard a voice, but saw nothing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</span></p>

<p>This voice, which declared itself to be N. H. said, “Call
for my parents, P. S. S. C., his wife and others, who appear
to you to know Christ, that they may hear and see; for they
will tell the truth.” I performed the errand, and those persons
came with more than forty others that night. I went
into the cellar and asked who should come. “They must
all come,” said she, “leave not a soul behind.” I gave the
information and they complied. The Spirit first asked her
parents whether they believed she was her daughter:
and they said, “yes.” “Do you want to see me?” said she.
And they said, “No.” She asked her father if he was ready
to go with her, if the Lord should call him. “I am afraid
I am not,” said he, “but the Lord can make me willing.”
“That is right,” she answered. Then after conversing with
her mother, in a very affecting manner, she said to both,
“You were my dear parents once; but now you are no more
to me than others.” Then to <abbr title="Captain">Capt.</abbr> P. S. she said, “You
have become hard against me.” “So I have,” said he.
“Do you love Christ?” “Yes, I do,” said she, “yes I do.”
P. S. “Then you love me.” “Yes, I do. Do you not remember
that soon after I was married, you told me that I
was married to G. B. and how happy I should be, if I was
married to Christ: and I said I was not; but I wished I was.”
P. S. “Yes, I remember it very well.” “Now I am married
to Christ,” said she, “now I am married to Christ, now
I am married to Christ.”</p>

<p>“You used to meet with us at my house, and once, at the
time of a certain prayer, I observed you to be much affected.”
“Yes, I was,” said she, “and the Lord was then
breaking my heart.”</p>

<p>I then spake to her myself, and said, I never knew that
you experienced a change of nature before you died, and I
should be glad if you would tell when you experienced it.
It was, said she, when I laid upon my death bed. Then she
spake to her parents, and reminded them of the conversation
which had passed between them at that time, respecting the
loss of her child. Then it was, said she, that I received my
change.</p>

<p>After much other conversation, which I do not remember,
the Spirit said to us, “There is one of this family, who is
not here.” Some person asked if we should go and call
him. She said, “No; I am going where he is. They say I
can appear no where but here; but I mean to convince them<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</span>
that I can appear in other places. I must appear before you
all this night, and go to the next house and to another.
You must all go up and be ready to walk with me. But
you must walk in order, two and two, solemnly, as if you
were following a friend to the grave. For the Lord is a God
of peace and not of confusion. Sing a Psalm as you walk,
and I will walk with Lydia after you.” We all went up,
and in about an hour after, we heard the token, and placed
ourselves before the door, and hearing it again, we walked
on to <abbr title="Captain">Capt.</abbr> M’s, and the Spirit knocked under his floor.
He and my son went down and, after conversing with my
son, she told <abbr title="Captain">Capt.</abbr> M. who she was, and the purpose of her
coming to his house, and asked him if he was satisfied, and
he told her that he was. Then she directed him to go up
and tell the people to stand in order before the door and she
would appear before them in the field. They did so, and
she appeared to them and disappeared, as some of them informed
me. By her direction we walked back to my house
in the same order, and then I saw her plainly about thirty
feet from me, in the form and stature of a person; white as
the light and moving after us like a cloud, without ambulatory
motion.

</p>

<p>I am not only a witness to many things in the preceding

o’clock in the day, while Mr. Blaisdel was gone for evidence,
the Spirit knocked, and M. M. and I went near to the place
of the sound and asked what was wanted.</p>

<p>The Spirit answered “I have come, I have come. Make
room for I am coming among you.”<a id="FNanchor_34" href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> I pleaded that she
would not. I must, I must, said she, don’t be scared. I
answered we were poor sinful creatures, and could not help
it, and again earnestly entreated her not to come.</p>

<p>I now plainly saw her appear in shining white; and she
asked me if any person in the house wanted to see her. I
then called on Miss P. C. who in the same hour had said
that “though she had heard the voice speak, she would not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</span>
believe it was that of a ghost.” I asked her now to come
and see her, and she did. Now, said the ghost, satisfy yourselves.
Here I am, here I am, satisfy yourselves. Miss P.
C. answered that she was satisfied.<a id="FNanchor_35" href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> The ghost then spake
several other things which I cannot remember.

<br>
<i>Testimony of <abbr title="Captain">Capt.</abbr> Paul Simson.</i><br>
</p>

<p>January 3, 1800, I was at the house of Mr. Blaisdel. His
son P. desired me to go with him into the cellar. I went
down with him and his two sisters, and Mrs. C. M.</p>

<p>I heard a rapping, and asked in the name of Christ what
it wanted. I heard a voice considerably loud, but could
not understand it. But some who were present, told me
that it said, “I am the voice of one crying in the wilderness.
Prepare ye the way of the Lord. Make his paths
strait. Seek ye the Lord, while he may be found; call upon
him while he is near.”</p>

<p>After some silence it rapped again. I spake to it in the
name of Christ, and said, if there was any thing it could
utter for peace, to utter it. It answered, “I am not to be
trifled with. I am not to be trifled with. I am not to be
trifled with. Peace, peace, peace.”<a id="FNanchor_36" href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</span>
Then they all went up, except Lydia and myself, and I
held her by the hand. She was much terrified, and said,
“I feel so I cannot stay: I must go up.” Stay awhile, said
I, perhaps it will speak again. “I cannot,” said she, and
began to urge me away. I consented, and when we had
come up, she told me what I had myself perceived, that the
cellar began to grow light, where the voice was uttered and
that she heard a rushing noise.</p>

<p>Sometime after I was in the same cellar with a number of
people and heard a plain voice; clearly understood by others,
but not at all by myself, though as near to it as others and
free from deafness. The voice appeared to me inimitable.</p>

<p>August 8, I was there again with thirty others and heard
the conversation of the Spectre with several persons. Mr.
N. H. mentioned his desire to handle her. “Handle me
and see,” said she, “for Christ tells you that a spirit is not
flesh and bones.”</p>

<p>Mr. T. U. said, “if you are a happy soul, intercede for
me.” The reply was, “None but Christ intercedes.”
“There are among us,” said Mr. U., “several denominations
of Christians: Presbyterians, Congregationalists, Baptists,
and Methodists. Which of all these are right?” The
voice answered, “There are good and bad of all these sorts
for the elect’s sake.”<a id="FNanchor_37" href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a></p>

<p>In August 13-14, while I was at the same house, the
Spirit informed us that she could not speak freely in the
night of August 9, because the behaviour of the people
had been so rude, but expressed her joy in discoursing with
christians. You know, said I, a thousand times more than
any of us. Yes I do, said she. Mr. Blaisdel said to me,
you stand too near her. Then I asked, do I stand too near
you? No, said she, stand as near as you please. I felt surprised,
and said, it was a wonderful event. Yes, the spirit
replied, it is a wonderful event indeed—do you not remember
what you told me, just after I was married that if I was
married to Christ, how happy I should live? Yes, I answered,
I remember it very well. She exhorted the young
people and told them that without a change they would be
miserable.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</span>
After this, the spirit expressed her resolution to convince
us that Mr. Blaisdel and his family were clear of the evils
alleged against them.</p>

<p>They say I am a witch and a devil, said she; and they
said that Christ was a devil. The spirit said other things,
which I remember not.</p>

<p>At last she told them she was about to appear in order to
convince them. Then by her direction we went up, and
having prayed together, and heard the token, we walked on
to <abbr title="Captain">Capt.</abbr> M’s, singing the 84th Psalm. I was one of the
foremost of the company and did not see it then; but the
greatest number of those who were behind me, said they
saw it plainly.</p>

<p>When we were at <abbr title="Captain">Capt.</abbr> M’s house, we stood in the field,
while Mrs. Butler, in great fear, walked with the Spirit before
us,<a id="FNanchor_38" href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> a few rods toward <abbr title="Captain">Capt.</abbr> Simson’s; and then returned
and told us that we must walk back, two and two, to
her father’s house singing, and the spirit would follow us
back. We did so. Mr. D. and I walked behind all, except
Mrs. Butler, in order if possible to see the apparition.
When we had walked about fifteen rods, I saw a white appearance
forward of us to the left hand. As we passed by
it, it fell in after us and walked with Mrs. Butler.</p>

<p>Mr. D. and I turned and looked upon them, and heard
them talk. We walked a little way further, stopped and
looked upon them, and heard them talk again; but they
spoke with so low a voice we could not understand them.
The spirit appeared in personal form, white as snow, about
as tall as Mrs. Butler.</p>

<p>It was now day-break. I turned my eyes from the object,
and in half a minute looked toward it again, but it was gone.
Mr. D. then told me he saw it disappear.

<br>
<i>Testimony of Mr. Samuel Ingalls.</i><br>
</p>

<p>August 13-14, 1800. I was at the house of Mr. Blaisdel
in the evening, with about forty people: went into the
cellar with a candle, which discovered to us the whole cellar,
so that no person here could be concealed from us. The
light being put out, we heard a knocking. It was spoken<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</span>
to, and a voice shrill and pleasant, like what I never heard
before, answered, (and talked with us.) Mr. Downing asked
her if she knew him, she said, yes: and called him by
name three times. She often uttered her sentences three
times. He asked the Spirit if she had never been at his
house. The answer was that she had been there once.</p>

<p><abbr title="Captain">Capt.</abbr> P. S. said, “You know as much as a thousand of
us;” “Yes, yes;” she answered, “but it will not be long
before some here will know as much.”</p>

<p>Mr. Blaisdel asked the Spirit when she experienced her
change. She answered that it was on her death bed; and
then uttered the words, “Glory, glory, glory. Alleluia.”</p>

<p>After some silence, some person asked the Spirit, “Are
you about to leave us?” She answered, “I must go when Jesus
calls. I must appear and walk with you this night; but
you must walk in order. I will walk behind with L. and
told us that she had walked with her before.” If you do,
said Mrs. Butler, I shall faint away. No, said the Spectre,
you shall not faint again; and then said to the people, “If
she faints again,<a id="FNanchor_39" href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> don’t you believe me.”<a id="FNanchor_40" href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a></p>

<p>Mrs. Butler never fainted after this. We went to <abbr title="Captain">Capt.</abbr>
M’s, and stood there. Mrs. Butler walked, as I was told
she was before ordered, several rods from us, and I saw something
appear white by her side, but no personal form. I
heard Mrs. Butler say that when the Spirit was with her and
talked with her, she was not so much afraid, as when she expected
her coming.

<p>August 13, 1800. After much conversation with the

TESTIMONY <abbr title="Seven">VII.</abbr><br>
<br>
<i>Testimony of Mr. John Simson.</i><br>
</p>

<p>August 8, 1800. I heard the discourse of the Spectre,
in company with about thirty other persons. The sound of
her voice was sometimes hoarse and faint, but for the most
part it was clear and free from any impediment, and then it
was inimitable, and the most delightful that ever I heard in
my life. In discoursing with her parents, she said, “My
dear parents, if the Lord should call you to go away with
me this night, are you willing.” I fear I am not, said her
father, but the Lord can make me willing. Yes, she answered,
and none but he.</p>

<p>While Mr. U. was talking with her, he observed that there
were among us various distinctions of christians, as Baptists,
Presbyterians and Methodists, and asked which of all these
are right. There are good and bad of all these sorts, said
she, for the elect’s sake. Mr. N. H. expressed his desire to
handle her. Handle me and see, said she: for Christ tells
you that a Spirit hath not flesh and bones. Accordingly,
after it was broad day-light, and we could all plainly see
each other, the outer cellar door being open, he extended
his arms round the space in which the voice was then speaking,
and exclaimed, “O, there is nothing here.” The voice
and this experiment were about four feet from me, so that
I am sure that no living person could be concealed from me.<a id="FNanchor_41" href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a>

TESTIMONY <abbr title="Eight">VIII.</abbr><br>
<br>
<i>Testimony of Mr. Richard Downing.</i><br>
</p>

<p>August 9, 1800. I went to the house of Mr. Blaisdel
with a number more. After sometime we heard a knocking.
Then four persons with me went into the cellar. A
light was called for and brought. We searched the cellar to
see if no person or thing might be found there whence that
knocking might proceed. Then the light was carried up,
and immediately there was the sound of knocking. Mr.
Blaisdel and Mr. D——ns several times asked what was
wanted. At length a voice answered, that, if we would all
go into the cellar, we should be satisfied;<a id="FNanchor_42" href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> we then all went<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</span>
down.<a id="FNanchor_43" href="#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> There was then in my hearing, much disorder and
much profanity among the people. Nothing remarkable
being heard, all but three or four of us left the cellar. Then
again there was a knocking several times, we spoke, but obtaining
no answer, I also went up.</p>

<p>Soon after I was informed that the voice had spoken to
those who remained there, declaring that we must all return,
and we went again. Immediately there was a knocking all
round the cellar by several persons there, as they afterwards
owned to me. Mr. Blaisdel desired them to be peaceable
and give room. After a few minutes, Mr. D——ns expressed
his sorrow that so many should be deceived, and advised
us to pray and return home. We therefore returned as unsatisfied
as we went.</p>

<p>On the 13th, while I was very much engaged in business,
I felt very much concerned for Mr. Blaisdel, on account of
his troubles, and thought I would go and see him, and advise
him to a settlement, to prevent the expense of the law.
I went, and he asked me the cause of my coming. I answered,
to visit him as a friend. I am glad to see you, said
he, you went away the other night very unsatisfied. You
did not then appear to be afraid: would you not be daunted
now? I told him I did not think I should. Providence,
said he, has sent you here, I believe, and you must tarry all
night. I told him I would. Then he informed me that he
had talked with the Spirit in the forenoon, which directed him
to persuade certain people to come to his house. About an
hour after sunset, the Spectre knocked; and being addressed,
answered, “I have come to satisfy you all; who is now
speaking to me?” It was answered, Mr. Blaisdel. Let him
and every one of this family, said the Spectre, go out from here.</p>

<p>They went out. The voice then said that Mr. Blaisdel’s
family were all clear of what was alledged against them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</span></p>

<p>After this, the voice talked with me. To know what answer
would be made, I asked, to whom are you speaking?
It answered, “Richard Downing.” I asked again, was you
ever at my house? It answered, “Yes, I was there once
with my mother, Mrs. M. and others, when your wife was
sick.” I had not then told any person what the Spectre now
told me, and which I and my family know to be true. Her
mother asked<a id="FNanchor_44" href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> how long before her decease, she experienced
her change. She answered, when I was on my death bed.</p>

<p>Soon after the Spirit said to the whole company, I will
walk with you to the next house, if you will walk in order,
two and two, singing a Psalm as you go; for God is a God
of order. I asked her what Psalm we should sing? Any,
said she, which may suit best. We then left the cellar, sang
and prayed, and immediately the token was given by knocking.
We then placed ourselves in order and walked on toward
<abbr title="Captain">Capt.</abbr> M’s house.</p>

<p>Anxious to unveil the deception, if there was any, I walked
near those who were foremost, and was first at the door
and knocked. <abbr title="Captain">Capt.</abbr> M. came to the door and asked what
all this meant. I answered, they are come to visit you.
Immediately I went and stood on the trap-door—the only
door of the cellar, that no person might go into it without
my knowledge. Some of the company told <abbr title="Captain">Capt.</abbr> M. our
design, and he made us welcome. Then hearing the miraculous
sound under the floor, <abbr title="Captain">Capt.</abbr> M. with others, went
down and talked with a voice, which I heard and understood
not; but was informed by them that she told them
she had come there to give evidence that she could be and
talk at other houses, as well as that of Mr. Blaisdel; and
that if the company would properly stand in the open field,
she would pass before them, so that they might see her.
The company did so. The Spirit then appeared and walked
back and forth, two or three times, in view of the company
and by the side of Mrs. Butler. This my eyes saw. The
apparition, with Mrs. Butler, having advanced a few rods,
disappeared. Mrs. Butler then came and told us that if we
would return to Mr. Blaisdel’s house, she would walk behind
us. The company complied. Having a desire so be
as near the apparition as possible, I walked with <abbr title="Captain">Capt.</abbr> P. S.
behind the whole company. Mrs. Butler walked behind<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</span>
<abbr title="Captain">Capt.</abbr> P. S. as she had been ordered by the apparition.
When we had walked about twenty rods, Mrs. Butler said,
“there it is now.” Where, said I. There, said she, pointing
to the left side of the company forward. I looked there
and saw the dark appearance of a person, and kept my eye
upon it till we passed by it, and till I saw it come in next
after me, and by the side of Mrs. Butler. Thus it followed
us. But now this object was become as white as the light.
As we walked, I kept my eye upon this object almost without
intermission, that I might see it disappear. It followed
us by one direct motion, like a cloud. The motion was not
ambulatory in the least degree. In this manner the apparition
followed us about twenty rods, and then disappeared in
my view. It opened into two parts and vanished.

TESTIMONY <abbr title="Nine">IX.</abbr><br>
<br>
<i>Testimony of <abbr title="Captain">Capt.</abbr> Samuel Simson.</i><br>
</p>

<p>August 5, 1800. In the evening after I had prayed, I
looked toward the opposite side of the room, and saw a white
personal form, having on a woman’s cap, and the same
countenance and features which Mrs. N. Butler had when
she was alive and in health, so that I knew her immediately.
In the name of the Lord, said I, for what purpose are you
here?—But there was no answer. I spoke again—“In the
name of the Lord Jesus Christ, who are you, and what do
you want here?” My wife greatly surprised, and seeing
nothing, asked what was the matter. I told her I saw an
apparition. No, she replied, you are deranged. It is the
moon you see. At that moment the apparition disappeared.
When we were composed, we agreed to mention the matter
to no person, and we conducted accordingly.</p>

<p>Two nights after, Mr. Blaisdel called us up about two
o’clock, and informed us that the Spirit had been at his
house, and sent him to call for more evidence. He desired
that we would go with him to his house. Well, said my
wife, she appeared here the night before last. Then perhaps
she has performed the message before me, said Mr. Blaisdel.
We went to his house. Hearing nothing for some time, by
the desire of Mr. Blaisdel I prayed with the company who
had collected there. Immediately after, we heard the usual
sound on the side of the house. We all went into the cellar,
and heard an articulate voice unlike any sound which I
ever heard before.

TESTIMONY <abbr title="Ten">X.</abbr><br>
<br>
<i>Testimony of Mrs. Sarah Simson.</i><br>
</p>

<p>I can attest to the truth of what my husband has now related,
and further, that when we were in the cellar, the
spirit told us that she was once N. H. N. B. repeating the
words three times, “you have done right,” said she, “you
have united in prayer: and it is true what that man said,
who made the prayer, he did see me with a cap on.” I am
sure Mr. Blaisdel could have told no one of it, for we had
not told him, nor any one else that the apparition had appeared
with that article of dress. I asked the spirit, are
you from happiness or misery? She replied, “I am from
above, I am not from beneath. I have come on God’s errand.”
Then she sung alleluias, and mentioned the cherubim
and seraphim. She told me that my child which I had
lost was in heaven, praising God with the angels. I should
have spoken to that man, said she, the other night, if some
person had not been affrightened. I asked, who was it?
She answered, it was his wife. Mr. Blaisdel and <abbr title="Captain">Capt.</abbr> M.
asked several questions, and the answers were wonderful.</p>

<p>August 9-10. I tarried after the people in general went
off with the opinion that the words of the spirit were in reality
the words of Mrs. Butler. I was much surprised with
the sound of knocking, which made the house tremble. I
then heard Mrs. Butler say, “If I am guilty, let her stay
away. If I am clear, let her come and clear me.” In a
few minutes after, she arose from a bed on which she had
sat, and stood wringing her hands in distress. What have I
done, said she, that I must be accused of all this. “Nothing,
dear, you have done nothing, but you must go into the
cellar,” answered a voice in a vacant space where no person
was—a voice the most delightful that ever I heard.</p>

<p>Some of the people then told her that she must do as the
spirit had said. So I must, said she, if I don’t she will come
into the room, and if she does, I shall die. She then went
down with a number of others, and immediately came up,
and told me that she was released. I was soon after informed,
that the spirit was about to appear, and that we
must all be present. I went with the rest, but prayed that
I might not see her. She had promised that none should
see her but those who desired it. Accordingly I did not see
her, though I looked directly before me, where they said
she was.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</span></p>

<p>August 13. I was again at the same house, and while I
was sitting in the room, near a candle, two persons came
and looked upon a watch, and found it twelve, and said it
was exactly what the spectre had just told. At one o’clock
they came again, and found the same agreement.

<br>
<i>Testimony of Mrs. Abigail Abbott.</i><br>
</p>

<p><a id="chg2"></a>August 10, 1800. I was at Mr. Blaisdel’s house, with
many more. In the first part of the night there was much
indecent conduct, and some profanity. The spirit knocked
sometimes, but uttered only a few words. The company in
general having in vain waited to see or hear something extraordinary,
withdrew; but I tarried with several other
persons. Soon after they were gone, the spectre knocked
several times very loud, and we went into the cellar. After
saying many things to us, she appeared in the shape of a
person and moved before us, without stepping, passing and
repassing several times. She gave so much light that we
could see other persons and other things in the cellar, which
we could not see before her appearance, nor afterwards. I
saw her appear and disappear several times. At last the
apparition came to <abbr title="Captain">Capt.</abbr> G. Butler, and then he appeared
to be immersed in her radiance so that he appeared white
and shining like the apparition. And I did particularly see
his hand in the midst of the apparent body of the apparition.
He cried in surprise, “Lord Jesus Christ.”</p>

<p>August 13-14, I was there again, and heard much conversation
of the ghost, with several other persons in the
cellar, concerning several events known only to her and
them in her life time. To all their questions she gave satisfactory
answers.</p>

<p>Once while she was speaking, I saw a bright shining
appearance in that part of the space from whence the voice
proceeded.</p>

<p>Her conversation and exhortation continued four hours.
One of the company observed to her that we were an hardened
people. “Yes,” she answered, “But the Lord will
call in his elect in his own time.” I went to <abbr title="Captain">Capt.</abbr> M’s with
the company, but did not then see her at all.

<br>
<i>Testimony of <abbr title="Captain">Capt.</abbr> Paul Blaisdel.</i><br>
</p>

<p>I have seen and discoursed with the apparition several
times. In the latter part of January, 1800, I saw her in
the field; first at a considerable distance from me: then
she came to me, and I particularly observed that she never
touched the ground. Her raiment appeared as white as
possible. The next evening she reproved me in the hearing
of several persons, because I had not spoken to her, and
because I had spoken against her. She told me she had
come on God’s errand, and that if I opposed her, I opposed
him who sent her.</p>

<p>The Spirit asked me if I lived in such a manner as I would
wish to die.<a id="FNanchor_45" href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a></p>

<p>I have from time to time heard the voice speak in open<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</span>
space, where I am sure no living person existed, as others
can testify who were with me.<a id="FNanchor_46" href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a> And upon August 9-10, I
was present and saw the Spectre when she appeared, and I
plainly saw <abbr title="Captain">Capt.</abbr> Butler’s hand pass through the apparition.</p>

<p>August 11, I saw her again, and heard her pious discourse,
with nearly twenty other persons. To those who were present,
I said, “She has her child now in her arms.” “Yes,
I have,” she answered, “yes I have.” She came so near to
me and others, that either of us could have handled her
without changing our places.</p>

<p>August 13. Being informed that the ghost had promised
to come this night, I left my father’s house, and went to
<abbr title="Captain">Capt.</abbr> M’s that I might not see nor hear her. Just before
daylight, she came to this house with more than forty people,
and reproved me again for speaking against her in the
presence of six or seven persons. This is the second time,
said the voice, that you have been warned.—Beware of the
third time. She asked me several times to handle her, to
see whether she had material substance or not. I confessed
to her that I believed her to be the spirit of N. H. Then I
went back with the company to my father’s house. Before
she vanished she came and stood within three feet from me.<a id="FNanchor_47" href="#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a>
The personal shape was all light, the particles of which had
constant motion. But I was afraid to put my hand upon
her.

<i>Testimony of Mr. David Hooper.</i><br>
</p>

<p>January 2, 1800. By the request of the spectre, sent by
two messengers, I went to Mr. Blaisdel’s house, and by conversing
with her, obtained such clear and irresistable tokens
of her being the spirit of my own daughter, as gave me no
less satisfaction than admiration and delight.</p>

<p>She gave a reason satisfactory to me why she put me to
the trouble of coming there instead of her coming to my
house.</p>

<p>By her request I went in a few days after to Mr. Butler’s
family and expressed my conviction to them.</p>

<p>August 8, I was there again, with my wife and many<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</span>
others. I again asked the ghost who she was. The voice
answered, “I was once N. B., your dear child. If the Lord
should call you this night, are you willing to go with me?”
I said the Lord can make me willing. Yes, she replied, and
none but he. Then she mentioned certain articles of property
which she had left, as belonging to us. I hope, said
I, these matters do not disturb you. “No, no,” she answered,
“No, no. Peace. There must be peace.”

<br>
<i>Testimony of Mrs. Joanna Hooper.</i><br>
</p>

<p>Her next words were spoken to me in particular. “Do
you not remember what I said on my death bed?” I answered,
yes, I do remember that you then said you desired
peace while you lived. Yes, I did, said she, yes I did.—Sometime
before this the spectre had sent this token to me,
which, though not certain, had yet been attended with such
circumstances, as rendered the use of it for deception utterly
improbable.</p>

<p>August 13, we went again. The spirit then asked if we
wanted to see her, and we both said no. Did I ask you in
your last sickness, said I, whether you was willing your child
should live? The voice answered, “yes, yes, and I told you
I should be a vile creature to desire the life of the child.”
[For that was the time in which it was God’s will it should
die.<a id="FNanchor_48" href="#Footnote_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a>] I asked this question for further satisfaction, knowing
that this very question and answer had passed between
us.</p>

<p>The spirit then told us that she had not freedom to converse
on the night of August 9, by reason of disorder and
profanity, and expressed her liberty and joy in discoursing
with christians. In the midst of her discourse with others,
I silently indulged my painful reflections on the distress of
her last sickness. Suddenly I was surprised with these
words of the voice to me, “Mourn not for me, for I am a
happy soul.”</p>

<p><abbr title="Captain">Capt.</abbr> P. S. observed that her free conversation with us
was a great wonder. “Yes, a miracle, said she, such as
never was since Christ was upon earth.”<a id="FNanchor_49" href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a> When she had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</span>
told us that without a change of heart, mankind would be
miserable, I desired Mr. Blaisdel to ask her when she experienced
her own change. He asked, and she answered,
“When I was on my death bed.” Mr. D. proposed this
question, “Do I believe that you are such as you profess to
be?” Her reply was, “You have believed, and you have
not believed, and satan will tempt you again.”<a id="FNanchor_50" href="#Footnote_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a> Then he
asked, “Was you ever at my house in your lifetime?”
“Yes, once, yes, once,” said she. I knew the time of this
visit, for Mrs. M. and I were there with her. By my desire
therefore, Mr. D. asked, “Who was there with you.” “My
mother and Mrs. M., said she, when your wife was sick.”
Then Mr. D. told the people that he remembered she had
been there at that time. Have you been any where but
here, said he, since your death. Yes, she answered, to five
places.</p>

<p>Mr. Blaisdel’s family being now excluded from that apartment
where the spirit was, she told us that Mr. Blaisdel’s
family were innocent. “They say I am a witch and a devil,
said she, and they said that Christ was a devil. It is reported
that some of this family have raised me, but it is not
in the power of man or devil to fetch a soul from heaven.”</p>

<p>After much more conversation the spirit told us that she
would walk with us to <abbr title="Captain">Capt.</abbr> M’s, and to another house beyond
it; but she only walked with us to <abbr title="Captain">Capt.</abbr> M’s, and
there talked with him and <abbr title="Captain">Capt.</abbr> P. B. to convince them
who she was.</p>

<p>When we had come within twenty rods of the house, the
company stopped. Then we two looked round and saw a
white shining appearance by the side of Mrs. Butler, and
about as tall as she.<a id="FNanchor_51" href="#Footnote_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a> After this, we observed nothing
worthy of particular notice.

TESTIMONY <abbr title="Eighteen">XVIII.</abbr><br>
<br>
<i>Testimony of Mrs. Eunice Scammons.</i><br>
</p>

<p>August 11, 1800. I was at the house which the ghost had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</span>
so often visited, and was one of seventeen people or more,
who were present when she appeared and conversed with us.
After she had discoursed particularly with several persons,
she said, “I am the voice of one crying in the wilderness,
prepare ye the way of the Lord and make his paths strait.
But you who are sinners, do not make them strait. Some
of you say that I am not a Spirit. Others, that I am an
evil Spirit. The words which I have spoken unto you, have
been misimproved, perverted and turned to ridicule. But I
shall see you all when you will not laugh.”</p>

<p>In the intervals of conversation, she sang praises.</p>

<p>Being asked who she was, she said, “I was once N. H.
and when I died I was N. B.,” and mentioned several circumstances
which attended her death to confirm her declaration.</p>

<p>After much other conversation, she appeared in the midst
of us and talked while she appeared. She came so near me
that I could have laid my hand upon her. She had before
solemnly entreated us to stand round separate and in such
order that all might see her while she moved in the midst
of us.<a id="FNanchor_53" href="#Footnote_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a> Within our two ranks she slowly passed and repassed
from end to end three times, and passed by me six
times. There were several persons in the company dressed
in white; but I could not see them at all, while the Spectre
was as white as any thing could possibly be. She moved in
such nearness to every one of us, that every one might have
handled her. I saw her vanish instantly in the midst of us.
After this, she spake to us again by exhortation. I am sent,
said she, to warn you against sin. I was myself a great
sinner when I lived in this world. In my last hours, I received
mercy. But if you go on in a course of sin and waste
your time as I did, it may not be so with you. One half
hour now gives me more happiness than this whole world
can give you through your whole lives.</p>

<p>It was now daylight, and she observed to us that it was
the Lord’s day, that we must retire to our homes and keep
it holy. She desired Mr. Blaisdel to pray with us before we
parted.</p>

<p>After many other words, she left us singing alleluias to
God and the Lamb. I heard the voice of her praises sounding
further and further from us, for a considerable time
before it entirely ceased uttering the words, “Alleluia, alleluia.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</span>
Glory, glory to God and the Lamb.” Her notes were
solemn and exceedingly delightful. Then we all went up,
and Mr. Blaisdel’s prayer was our dismission.

TESTIMONY <abbr title="Nineteen">XIX.</abbr><br>
<br>
<i>Testimony of Mrs. Mary Bragdon.</i><br>
</p>

<p>Sometime in January, 1800, I was at the house of Mr.
Blaisdel, and heard such a voice as I never heard before
among the living; and they told me it was that of the Spirit,
talking with Mr. and Mrs. Butler.</p>

<p>August 7. At the same house we heard a knocking on the
partition next to the chimney, where no person could be.
Then several persons with me went into the cellar, and the
Spirit told us she was once Nelly Butler. She told me that
I must not be scared.</p>

<p>August 13. I was again at the house with forty-eight
others, besides children. The Spirit, after her conversation
with several persons, exhorted the youth: “I was once young
and vain as you, said the voice, and, if the Lord had taken
me away in that condition, how miserable I should have
been! Now is the time, while you are young, to seek the
Lord. Delay not till it is too late.” Then it was that I saw
a white personal form shining in the space from whence the
voice proceeded; and I afterwards saw the same appearance
in the field.

<br>
<i>Testimony of Mrs. Dorcas Johnson.</i><br>
</p>

<p>I was present at the house, and at the time dated, August
13, by other testimonies. There I heard and saw the Spectre.
Her voice was distinct from any other, and her music
the most delightful that I ever heard. When she walked
with us, she moved without stepping. And when we arrived
at the house, by direction of the Spectre given to my brother,
James Springer, and by him to the company in our
hearing, we opened to the right and left, so that the Spectre
and Mrs. Butler passed together between our two ranks.
Then she vanished from my view and I saw her no more.

<h2>MISCELLANEOUS REFLECTIONS.</h2>
</div><!--end chapter header-->
<div class="figcenter20">
 <img src="images/i074.jpg"
 alt="decorated line">
</div><!--end figcenter-->

<p>Two Inferences naturally arise from this topic: one is
that of caution. “Judge not that ye be not judged.”</p>

<p>The above witnesses are exhibited, not for the want of
more, (for more than a hundred have seen the Spectre, or
have heard her words,) but because repetition is tedious.</p>

<p>Our opponents now, we expect, will admit our inquiry of
what they have to say against these attestations, whether
any thing false—whether any thing even wearing a deceptive
color has been presented to public notice.</p>

<p>It would have been my peculiar pleasure to have given
more satisfaction with regard to the superior ends of the
messages, subservient, no doubt, to still greater ends, if it
had been lawful. But for the present, they are immediately
interesting only to a few persons. The knowledge which
many would improve, others would abuse. If the answer
of the oracle intended for the personal safety of David and
his men, is immediately published, Saul will know it.</p>

<p>When a creature professedly brings us a message from
God, be this message ever so small, ever so strange, ever so
unexpected; yet, if it does not oppose his word, we have
not the least evidence that the profession is counterfeit, unless
we obtain it by other means; because we are as yet
ignorant of its connections, and God’s thoughts and plans
are not like ours.</p>

<p>Some say, if the message appear not in the scriptures,
that will sufficiently condemn it and the messenger too,
whatever be the credentials, “I will obey nothing but what
I see in the scriptures.”<a id="FNanchor_54" href="#Footnote_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a> But may I not say, with Doctor
Owen, that they unwarrantably limit the Holy One of Israel?
In absolute monarchies the people dare not say, “I will obey
no precept from the king, unless I find it in the public code.”
Such language would breathe rebellion. And dare we treat
thus the King of kings, who is an absolute monarch, and by
his propriety in the universe has a right to be such? Will
the scriptures themselves warrant this behavior? Can we
despise the message and them who heard it, and them who
obeyed it, and the angels who brought it, and yet stand
guiltless before Him who sent it? until we obtain proof that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</span>
he did not send it, and that the credentials are forgery?
And are we one inch nearer to this point, than we were
twenty-six years ago? Do we perceive <em>now</em> any more than
twenty-six years ago, how the deceiver talked in open space,
by a voice inimitable, clearly understood by some, and not
at all by others, with means of intelligence every way equal?
Our blessed Lord, to prove that he was not a Spectre, said,
“Handle me and see.” That is implicitly to say, if you
handle me and find no substance, then you may conclude
that I am a spirit. Our Spectre said, “Handle me and see.”
And earnestly insisted on this experiment time after time.
Can we tell <em>now</em>, why that very argument and mode of evidence
which Christ himself used, is not valid and genuine,
any more than we could twenty-six years ago? If not, let
me be cautious, whatever be the conduct of this enlightened
age, how I accuse my neighbors of folly or villainy, merely
because they enjoyed interviews with a departed friend;
lest I be found among those who speak evil of things which
they understand not.</p>

<p>The Jews, besides their public code of revelation, had their
Urim and Thummim for the particulars of duty. Is it certain?
Is it even rational to suppose that the few answers of
that oracle mentioned in the scriptures, are the only ones
ever communicated? Prophets, too, were sent to manifest
the particulars of duty, and angels, some of whom <em>might be</em>
the spirits of just men. And we have no reason to doubt
but Moses was a Spectre when he conversed with Christ on
the Holy Mount; notwithstanding that old fiction of his
resurrection, which has dishonored the antiquities of Josephus.</p>

<p>Now the question is, what person ever yet demonstrated
that no such occasional revelation was ever wanted in any
hour since the completion of the scriptures? Certainly this
completion never precluded spectral missions in the view of
the christian fathers. And their continuation has been the
constant faith of christians in general, down to this day of
deism. And the war of the deists against this opinion is
easily accounted for: because the admission of Spectres is
the admission of miracle; and the admission of occasional
revelation, brings a question to their door which would be a
troublesome neighbor. <em>Why then should not a revelation be
needful for the public?</em> Great is their obligation to modern
christians for their assistance in this warfare. It may be
asked, if these missions have been thus continued, why have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</span>
they generally been attended with so few witnesses? But
if there be evidence enough for him, or those who are interested
in the message, it is sufficient for their purpose, whether
others believe it or not.</p>

<p>When David was told by the Urim that the men of Keilah
would deliver him into the hand of Saul, no person appears
to have been present but Abiather; but if the oracle was
attended with the evidence described by Josephus, there
was evidence enough for the purpose of David and his men,
whether five other persons in the whole nation believed it
or not.</p>

<p>After all, it is not our duty to expect apparitions, for they
never come to gratify curiosity; nor to pray for their coming,
unless our case be peculiar as that of Manoah; nor to
entertain the idea that their speaking to us, would make a
more durable impression than the preaching of the living.
Such conduct and apprehensions are erroneous, and expose
us to greater delusion. Our Lord has expressly taught us
that, if we believe not Moses and the prophets, neither shall
we be persuaded, though one rose from the dead. And accordingly
the affectionate and persuasive addresses of the
Spectre in this place, which drew tears from every eye, had
no happy, durable influence on the unregenerate character
in a single instance.</p>

<p>It was necessary that religion should appear in all her
conduct and conversation, otherwise her profession would
have been justly suspected. But on that Lord’s day morning,
mentioned in several testimonies, she did not say to the
people, <em>Tarry and hear me</em>. No, but “Retire to your homes,
read the bible, pray and keep the day holy.”<a id="FNanchor_55" href="#Footnote_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a> That is to say,
attend to those ample and most suitable means of grace
which God has appointed for you in his written word.</p>

<p>The preaching of the gospel was not her design; but she
had other designs which appropriate the sentence, “I am not
to be trifled with.”</p>

<p>In some old fashioned minds, her familiar conversation
may excite the suspicion of necromancy and divination, by
a <em>familiar</em> spirit, so plainly forbidden in the law of Moses:
and then doubtless Mrs. Butler must bear the accusation.
But there is no evidence that this angel conversed more familiarly
with her than with others who were never suspected.
She conversed familiarly with all those who had much conversation
with her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</span></p>

<p>The ancient idea of a familiar spirit appears not to have been
obtained from the familiar conversation of any person with a spirit,
(though sometimes the inquirer might be deceived by the artificial
resemblance of it) but from the opinion that certain persons had a
spirit foreign to their own, residing in them and uttering oracles
from their bodies.<a id="FNanchor_56" href="#Footnote_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a> These persons were a sort of ventriloquists.
Their conduct is described by Rollin in his account of the Grecian
Oracles. The speech of their familiar spirit was imagined to proceed,
not from the lips of any person, but from a part of their own
bodies, in some manner artificially swollen. This is confirmed by
their very name <em>Abefeth</em>, in the Hebrew language, which has the
signification of swelling. The familiar spirit itself was called <em>Afeb</em>,
which is the same noun in the singular number. The swollen part
and the familiar spirit, which was imagined to reside in it, had one
name. “Divine unto me by the Afeb,” said Saul, 1 <abbr title="Samuel">Sam.</abbr> 28: 8.
Divine unto me by the <em>swelling</em>, and bring me up whom I shall
name unto thee. But it does not appear that the woman had any
time for divination. She saw Samuel unexpectedly, and cried out
for fear:<a id="FNanchor_57" href="#Footnote_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a> and Samuel, instead of being familiar with her, never
spake a single word to her. Now it is not even pretended that any
such token of Afeb or necromancy, have appeared among us.</p>

<p>Doubtless this wickedness among the ancients, was for the most
part legerdemain,<a id="FNanchor_58" href="#Footnote_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a> and their predictions always uncertain, as appears
not only from their ambiguity, but from the public estimation
of some oracles in preference to others, and of the Delphic oracle
above all the rest.</p>

<p>From the observations now made, we learn the criminality of
witchcraft or legerdemain, for there is no essential difference between
them.</p>

<p>To counterfeit the royal seal was ever a capital crime. How
presumptuously criminal then are they, who counterfeit the royal<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</span>
seal of heaven! The certificate of divine revelation, such is the
conduct of every mountebank, while the spectator is left ignorant of
his art. His false miracles spread a cloud of uncertainty over the
minds of men, so that many are at loss how to distinguish the true
miracle, the true seal of the King of heaven, from its counterfeit.
And they who countenance and encourage such persons, are guilty
of far greater evil than the great evil of wasting time and property.
But such behaviour is the food of infidelity. No wonder it is so
common at the present day.</p>

<p>Whether the writer is one who gives such countenance and encouragement,
is for the next writer on the subject of these pages to
shew,<a id="FNanchor_59" href="#Footnote_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a> not by pointing out inaccuracies here and there, for this any
person may easily do, but by presenting to the public a complete,
satisfactory analysis of this whole mystery.</p>

<p>To his particular notice, I ask leave to offer a few cautionary observations;
if needless for him, they may assist another.</p>

<p>Among so many of us who have heard and seen the Spectre, it
would be very strange, if, in the course of twenty-six years past,
no one should have deviated from the strait line of perfect rectitude.
If imperfection should be found among us, and the publicity of it
will cast any light upon this subject, by all means let it come forth:
if not, let him, who is without sin, cast the first stone.</p>

<p>The question is not, <em>How have we conducted</em>, unless our conduct
be such as invalidates our evidence: for we are liable to evil every
day; but, <em>How has the Spectre conducted?</em> and <em>who could she be?</em>
It has been frequently reported among people at a distance from
this scene, for more than twenty years, that the whole business was
an artifice, and fairly proved to be such. We who believe the existence
of the Spectre, have thought that this inaccurate on dit has
had currency long enough. Our respondent, therefore, will not fail
to shew our mistake, by demonstrating that this report is indeed
correct. Suppose then, (no matter how distant the supposition is
from what has really happened) suppose then, I say, that, in the
course of his zealous inquiries, our respondent should find that he,
who pretends to have discovered the plot, is a witness in favor of
the Spectre, and that his testimony was connected with a solemn
and public profession of his firm belief that the Spectre was really
such as she professed to be. Suppose further, that in contemplating
the dates of these events, our respondent should find that the discovery
preceded that testimony and that solemn, public profession:
to say nothing of the numerous other witnesses who might contradict
him. In such a case I should imagine that a discerning, wary
and unprejudiced reader would give but a cold assent to his process
of demonstration.</p>

<p>It is my earnest desire that the reply may honor the author by
the expressions of candor, philanthropy and grand thought. If his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</span>
talent be that of a Swift or a Juvenal, his temptation will be great
to adopt the loose style of the infidel. Let not compliance deceive
the unwary. Between ridicule and reasoning the distinction is
eternal. The most important and solemn truths have been the subject
of both. The sober school of Socrates furnished a comedy for
the Athenian stage. And Voltaire could tell us from the Apocalypse,
how incommodious their situation will be who shall inhabit
the upper story of New Jerusalem.</p>

<p>Unhappy man! thy fruits of genius furnished a feast of intellectual
dainties. But the figs of Cleopatra covered the basilisk,
and a world was ruined by the tree of knowledge. The termination
of Satyre was horror; and the pure day of awful truth now
glaring upon thee from every point has impressed sobriety eternal.</p>

<p>The result of this whole inquiry is that of consolation. Our
death will not be total. Our souls will survive our bodies. We
shall think and reason and know the moral conduct of this world,
and perhaps the very names of particular persons, after our bodies
are turned to dust.</p>

<p>Among us are a considerable number of people who say that the
Spectre knew and told them their thoughts past, present or future,
or all three; and such thoughts as she could not have known or conjectured
by ordinary means. To one of them, whose veracity is
doubted by none, she foretold the time, before several witnesses,
when his mind would be struck with horror for opposing her messages.</p>

<p>When the time was come, which was about six months after the
prediction, his mind at first, as he informed me, was calm as usual.
To disturb him he saw nothing, expected nothing, and was about to
reject the prediction as nothing. Instantly he was surprised by a
new train of ideas. The evil of his conduct was set in order before
him, and his distress was apparent to others, as some of them, whose
witness cannot for a moment be suspected, informed me.</p>

<p>Now this instance alone, would prove but little; yet, when connected
with ten or twelve others, of undoubted credibility, attesting
the same kind of experience, while they have no visible combination
by kindred, employment, age or interest, it is certainly worthy
of some consideration.</p>

<p>If one departed saint is capable of knowing our thoughts, so may
others. That uncorporeal spirits are witnesses of the conduct of
this world, appears not only from that of Spectres, but from the
scriptures, as in <abbr title="Daniel">Dan.</abbr> 8: 13. <abbr title="Revelation">Rev.</abbr> 6: 10. 
<abbr title="Ecclesiastes">Eccl.</abbr> 5: 6. 1 <abbr title="Timothy">Tim.</abbr> 5: 21.
No reason can be assigned why our conduct may not be as
visible to a saint made perfect, as to an angel: for neither of them
can know us by bodily organs, such as we now possess, and their
knowledge of our thoughts without these organs, is just as easily
accounted for, as their knowledge of our external conduct. The
spirits of just men, when they leave this world, are made perfect.
“But when that which is perfect is come, then that which is in part<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</span>
shall be done away. Now I know in part; but then shall I know,
even as also I am known.” This cannot mean that I shall know
other souls and even Christ himself as <em>perfectly</em> as he knows me;
but I shall know them in the same manner. I shall know other
souls <em>intuitively</em> as Christ knows me. Indeed, what idea can we
have of mere spirits seeing each other, and being present with each
other, but that of the mutual intuition of thoughts?</p>

<p>If that day should find the saints as ignorant of the human character
as they are at the hour of death, their judgment will be of
small account for their own satisfaction or that of others.</p>

<p>And should evasion tell us that Christ and his angels will then
reveal to the saints the character of this world; still this character
would be only the object of faith, not of sight, and satan and his
adherents, could say that the saints had condemned them for the
most part by hear-say, and that of those who had always opposed
them from the beginning.</p>

<p>Now it does not seem probable that the enemies of Christ will
ever find occasion for such a plea as this. Every mouth will be
stopped. And the mouths of wicked men will be stopped, not merely
by the testimony of foreign angels, but by witnesses taken from
their own family, and such too as have been the greatest and most
constant friends that ever they had in the world: such as had counselled
and warned them—had experienced the most cordial and
warmest zeal for their salvation and had often wept for them in secret
places. Thus mankind will be judged by their peers. Their
quarrel with God and each other, will be decided in their own family.
“The Father judgeth no man, but hath committed all judgment
to the Son,” in union with his spiritual members, and there
must be knowledge in them for this purpose. And what better
method of acquiring it can we conceive so easy and natural as that
of their contemplating the moral conduct of mankind through all
ages of the world. May we not then indulge the idea that, when
the humble and afflicted leave this body of sin and death, they hear
the voice of the Beloved saying, “Come ye blessed of my Father:”
possess in perfection my spirit of holiness and unerring wisdom, to
know as you as are known. Great is the work for which you are
ordained. You have been faithful over a few things, I will make
you ruler over many. You must judge the world with me. Henceforth
watch their conduct, know their character, and prepare for it.</p>

<p>Hence it follows that we do nothing in secret. All our behaviour
is known, not only to Christ, but to the watchers, his holy ones.
With them is the book of God’s remembrance.</p>

<p>O gracious Redeemer, shed abroad thy love in our hearts. May
faith and patience have their perfect work. Beautify us with thy
moral likeness, that we may be fair in thine eyes and in the eyes of
our kindred who dwell with thee. With them at last may we behold
thy glory and celebrate thy love forever.

<p class="footnote"><a id="Footnote_11" href="#FNanchor_11" class="label">[11]</a> Since the Deity has assumed our nature, his being comprises Divine intelligence
and human intelligence. The former is intuitive; the latter reasons
sometimes for the investigation of truth; yet being in a sense made Divine, is
the infallible source and medium of all our spiritual knowledge, grace and happiness.
Now as intelligence is the very essence of personality, distinction of
intelligence must be the distinction of personality. Therefore the Divine Intelligence
is the Divine Person, and the human intelligence, is the human person.
The Divine breathing, too, called the Holy Ghost, is a person in the figurative
sense; several personal pronouns being applied to this Divine afflatus
in the Scriptures. Our meaning thus explained, we may truly say that there
are three Persons in the Deity, Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, all comprised in
our glorious Saviour, in whom dwells all the fulness of the Deity bodily. But
the doctrine of there being literally three distinct personal divinities in the Deity,
has no foundation in the Scriptures.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a id="Footnote_13" href="#FNanchor_13" class="label">[13]</a> i. e. On the distinction between the original and required perceptions of sight.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a id="Footnote_14" href="#FNanchor_14" class="label">[14]</a> To him she had before sent several messages by several persons of different
families.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a id="Footnote_15" href="#FNanchor_15" class="label">[15]</a> I hear your objection. “There was a reason for her being consoled. Make
me believe, if you can, that, if her professed ignorance of the affair was real;
the appearance and discourse of a ghost by her side, would not augment her
fears and distress.” But remember, dear sir, that experience in this case is the
best teacher. More than thirty witnesses of both sexes, are against you; all
declaring that though at first the ghost excited terror; yet, after a little discourse
with her, their fears were entirely dissipated, and succeeded by peculiar pleasure:
so familiar and delightful was the mode of her address and conversation.
At this time Mr. Blaisdel heard the conversation distinctly, but saw nothing.
His daughter both saw and heard.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a id="Footnote_16" href="#FNanchor_16" class="label">[16]</a> This was ordered by the ghost.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a id="Footnote_17" href="#FNanchor_17" class="label">[17]</a> That all these reasons were assigned at <em>that juncture</em>, I pretend not to say.
Probably they were not; but certain it is, that she expressed them all to her
friends at different times.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a id="Footnote_18" href="#FNanchor_18" class="label">[18]</a> Voltaire, in his philosophical dictionary, treating the Bible and ghosts with
equal ridicule, says that the latter, “used to hie away at the crowing of the
cock.” The same was the idea of Shakespeare in his ghost of Hamlet, “Adieu,
the glow worm shews the morning to be near.” But this we now see, is not
always the case.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a id="Footnote_19" href="#FNanchor_19" class="label">[19]</a> These two, by their own desire, had obtained a promise that they should not
see her. There were several such instances at different times.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a id="Footnote_20" href="#FNanchor_20" class="label">[20]</a> A place in the house most distant from that of the Spectre.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a id="Footnote_21" href="#FNanchor_21" class="label">[21]</a> This meeting was the wedding. He who is able to receive it, let him receive
it. One infinitely greater than this Spectre, attended the marriage at Cana
in Galilee.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a id="Footnote_22" href="#FNanchor_22" class="label">[22]</a> In about an hour after she appeared to forty of this assembly. But I must
here also insert a particular observation of Dr. Rush in his chapter of illusions;
“When a person fancies that he hears voices and sees objects, which do not
exist, he has these sensations alone. The voice supposed to be heard, says he,
and the objects supposed to be seen, are never heard nor seen by two persons,
even when they are close to each other.”—<cite>Disease of the Mind, chapter 15.</cite></p>

<p class="footnote">The inference then is certain, with respect to those witnesses, that no mental
disease could be the true origin of their hearing and vision.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a id="Footnote_23" href="#FNanchor_23" class="label">[23]</a> This only means that they were together at a little distance from the rest of
the company in the same apartment.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a id="Footnote_24" href="#FNanchor_24" class="label">[24]</a> She then expressed not only her own feelings but those of the family. The
idea of a Spectre coming into the room, where they commonly were, was distressing
to them, as already observed.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a id="Footnote_25" href="#FNanchor_25" class="label">[25]</a> I find no evidence that these two went without others.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a id="Footnote_26" href="#FNanchor_26" class="label">[26]</a> This experience is testified by all who saw and heard.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a id="Footnote_27" href="#FNanchor_27" class="label">[27]</a> This, however, he denies, but suppose it were true, why was it improper
that in his own house he should choose the place where he would stand? If they
knew where he was, that was sufficient.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a id="Footnote_28" href="#FNanchor_28" class="label">[28]</a> See the date in the last letter, page 39.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a id="Footnote_29" href="#FNanchor_29" class="label">[29]</a> He had said that Mr. Blaisdel’s family could not raise the Spirit any where
but in their own house, as several testified.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a id="Footnote_30" href="#FNanchor_30" class="label">[30]</a> That is, that they heard the same words.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a id="Footnote_31" href="#FNanchor_31" class="label">[31]</a> There was not only this similarity in voice, but the same phrases, which she
was accustomed to use, and which were peculiar to her in her life time, she uttered
now, as several of her intimate acquaintances have informed me.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a id="Footnote_32" href="#FNanchor_32" class="label">[32]</a> She had come several times before, as the preceding letters show. Five
months before this, Mr. Blaisdel’s son P. and his sisters, were sent by the ghost
to a house where several young people were met for amusement; not for this
purpose, but for terminating a difference between them and one of that company.
The ghost strictly charged them to go and return in peace, and to abstain
from all appearance of evil. The propriety of this small errand appears by its
connections and the events which followed. But, as it stands insulated before
the eyes of pride and folly, how despicable it must appear! Had such eyes looked
on, when the first silk worm was formed, it would have appeared a trivial and
useless contrivance. “As the heavens are higher than the earth; so are my
ways higher than your ways, saith the Lord, and my thoughts than your
thoughts.” It would be very strange indeed, if a messenger from heaven should
have much to perform in such a world as this, and yet meet with no opposition;
and equally strange, if that messenger should perform nothing but what mankind
would naturally expect, especially in a period when christians themselves
have not escaped the contagion of infidelity.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a id="Footnote_33" href="#FNanchor_33" class="label">[33]</a> The children, through fear, had moved their beds into the room where their
parents lodged.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a id="Footnote_34" href="#FNanchor_34" class="label">[34]</a> These words were heard by eight persons.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a id="Footnote_35" href="#FNanchor_35" class="label">[35]</a> This answer she now denies; but owns she saw the apparition.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a id="Footnote_36" href="#FNanchor_36" class="label">[36]</a> These enigmatical warnings were some of the first words which the voice
uttered, and they appeared strange to us all. They appeared void of instruction,
impertinent and utterly inapplicable to any thing which was seen, remembered,
or expected among us. None were then trifling with her; all wondered,
and many were solemnized. Nor was there any remarkable contention among
us. But after she had produced her strange, unexpected, unheard of message,
our behaviour soon fixed the meaning of these enigmas, and rendered them like
apples of gold and pictures of silver. Her speaking so much in a by-place (a
cellar) separate from the common dwelling of man, like John in the wilderness,
has offended us. If her paths were the Lord’s, instead of making them strait,
we have made them crooked by misconception, misrepresentation, and falsehood.
While the ghost was then speaking, one of the company was near eternity.
Therefore “seek the Lord while he may be found.”</p>

<p class="footnote">With what contempt and ridicule has the ghost been treated on account of
the marriage! Therefore “I am not to be trifled with,” was pertinent. What
violent contentions, occasioned by her messages, appropriate the terms “Peace,
peace,” or “there must be peace,” as she more plainly said to another person
about the same time.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a id="Footnote_37" href="#FNanchor_37" class="label">[37]</a> Here we see that the direct answer was entirely avoided. It was no design
of her mission. We have the Bible by which even the angels must be tried.
To the law and the testimony. If they speak not according to this word, it is
because they have no light in them, from whatever world they may profess to
come. She accordingly took this ground, and reasoned with the people out of
the Scriptures as the standard of truth by which she would be tried.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a id="Footnote_38" href="#FNanchor_38" class="label">[38]</a> It was matter of trial to some christians among us, that the Spirit should
thus associate with one who never gave the least evidence of piety: But the
Spirit informed them, out of her hearing, that Mrs. Butler was one of the elect,
and would repent before she left the world.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a id="Footnote_39" href="#FNanchor_39" class="label">[39]</a> She had several times fainted before.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a id="Footnote_40" href="#FNanchor_40" class="label">[40]</a> “Don’t you believe a word of all that I have told you,” say some who
heard it.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a id="Footnote_41" href="#FNanchor_41" class="label">[41]</a> She now talked without appearing. It was the next night after this, that
the attempt was made to handle her while she appeared.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a id="Footnote_42" href="#FNanchor_42" class="label">[42]</a> The last member of this sentence is matter of dispute.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a id="Footnote_43" href="#FNanchor_43" class="label">[43]</a> This shews that this witness was not in the cellar, when the preceding sentence
was uttered. They who were there, say that it was the Spectre who said,
<em>they must come down</em>, and Mr. Blaisdel who added that <em>they should be satisfied</em>.
Others tell us that the sentence was, “Come down <em>in order</em>, and you shall be
satisfied.”</p>

<p class="footnote">Make the worst of it; it was but innocent inaccuracy, like what is recorded
of angels in the scriptures. Possibly the ghost did not foresee this confusion.
Certain it is, that she constantly and strictly insisted upon order and solemnity,
as indispensably requisite to her manifestations. After all, if the ghost has ever
uttered one falsehood, or <em>one</em> false accusation, with the manifest design of injurious
deception; or, if she has ever committed or ordered the commission of
<em>one</em> crime; we must, without hesitation, condemn her as an evil angel. But
then we must remember that her criminality should first be proved, not by our
surmises or conjectures, but by substantial, plenary, and indubitable evidence.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a id="Footnote_44" href="#FNanchor_44" class="label">[44]</a> Here is a little mistake. It was not her mother, but Mr. Blaisdel who
proposed this question, by her mother’s desire expressed to him.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a id="Footnote_45" href="#FNanchor_45" class="label">[45]</a> This sentence was uttered at another time. It is believed by some, among
whom is the writer, that several interviews mentioned in the last letter were not
those of N. H., but of another Spectre. This may be somewhat difficult, and
doubtless not essentially necessary to prove.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a id="Footnote_46" href="#FNanchor_46" class="label">[46]</a> That is, that they experienced the same.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a id="Footnote_47" href="#FNanchor_47" class="label">[47]</a> “Before she vanished.” That is, before she vanished for the last time that
morning, for this was after she had vanished in the view of Mr. Downing, as
in Testimony 8.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a id="Footnote_48" href="#FNanchor_48" class="label">[48]</a> These last words declared to me by other witnesses are not in the original
testimony of Mrs. H. I have therefore enclosed them.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a id="Footnote_49" href="#FNanchor_49" class="label">[49]</a> Her messages were probably such as never were since Christ was on earth.
Some of them are contrary to all expectation, and exposed the families of Mr.
Blaisdel, Mr. Hooper, <abbr title="Captain">Capt.</abbr> Butler, and Mrs. Butler, in particular, to unjust
reproach. Therefore the loving kindness of the Lord to these families, made
the proofs as extraordinary as the messages, that whoever shall calumniate
either of those families, on account of these events, may do it at their peril.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a id="Footnote_50" href="#FNanchor_50" class="label">[50]</a> Mr. D. has since declared that he had found all these words to be true.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a id="Footnote_51" href="#FNanchor_51" class="label">[51]</a> They saw no personal form.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a id="Footnote_52" href="#FNanchor_52" class="label">[52]</a> The greatest things are from among the least.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a id="Footnote_53" href="#FNanchor_53" class="label">[53]</a> The order was nearly elliptical; for the two ranks were joined by certain
persons at each end.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a id="Footnote_54" href="#FNanchor_54" class="label">[54]</a> Whatever message enlarges or diminishes their doctrine or worship, must
undoubtedly be rejected and the messenger too. But beware of extremes.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a id="Footnote_55" href="#FNanchor_55" class="label">[55]</a> There was no preacher in the town that day.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a id="Footnote_56" href="#FNanchor_56" class="label">[56]</a> <em>To have a familiar spirit</em>, as expressed in the Old Testament, and, <em>To have a
demon</em>, as expressed in the New; seem to be phrases of the same import, and
the idea of it was that of criminality. But we find no person in the New Testament
justly accused of it.</p>

<p class="footnote">Demoniacs were of another description. They were esteemed innocent, and
pitied, as being afflicted by the demons.</p>

<p class="footnote">Possibly this in part was the true evil which afflicted part of our land in
1692, and which our pious ancestors unhappily mistook for witchcraft.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a id="Footnote_57" href="#FNanchor_57" class="label">[57]</a> The original of verse 11-12, is strictly thus: “And he said, bring me up
Samuel. And the woman saw Samuel and cried out.” This strongly intimates
that Samuel came unexpectedly and without any previous divination.
The word <em>when</em>, in our translation has no responsive in the original.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a id="Footnote_58" href="#FNanchor_58" class="label">[58]</a> Not altogether such, why else should the oracles cease at the time of our
Saviour’s birth? Legerdemain found no more difficulty afterwards than before.
God did in his righteous judgment, choose the delusions which they had
chosen for themselves. He sometimes fulfilled their predictions, <abbr title="Deuteronomy">Deut.</abbr> 13: 1,
2, 3. <abbr title="Ezekiel">Ezek.</abbr> 21: 22 to 25; and might sometimes, though very seldom, suffer
such real miracles as were either vain, or injurious; but never those of benevolence.
Compare the magic of Egypt with <abbr title="Revelation">Rev.</abbr> 16: 14. The demons drowned
the swine, but never gave rain; <abbr title="Isaiah">Isa.</abbr> For satan must not oppose satan.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a id="Footnote_59" href="#FNanchor_59" class="label">[59]</a> Should they appear worthy of such painful notice.</p>
